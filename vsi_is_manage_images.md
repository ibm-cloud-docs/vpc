# Managing custom images
{: #managing-custom-images}

After you import a custom image to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can view details about the image, manage the lifecycle of the image, use the image to create a virtual server instance, export the image, and even share it with a private catalog.
{: shortdesc}

- To manage an image from volume, see [Managing image from volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc-manage&interface=ui).
- To use a custom image in a private catalog, see [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui).

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources consistently across {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information about access requirements for custom images, see the IAM roles and actions information in [Image Service for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions#is.image-roles).

For details about the `$vpc_api_endpoint` and `$iam_token` variables in the following examples, see the Authentication and Endpoint URLs sections in [Virtual Private Cloud API Introduction](/apidocs/vpc/latest#about-vpc-api).
{: api}

## Managing custom images by using the UI
{: #custom-images-managing-ui}
{: ui}

You can manage an image by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Images**.
2. On the **Custom images** tab, click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for a specific image and select from the available options. Encrypted custom images are identified by a lock icon after the image name. You can select from the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Rename | Rename the custom image. |
| Create virtual server instance | Create a new virtual server from the custom image. |
| Export | Copy the custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. |
| Share to catalog | Share the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image to an existing private catalog. |
| Copy | Copy the UUID of the custom image. |
| View checksum | View the checksum for the custom image. |
| Schedule lifecycle | Opens the **Schedule image lifecycle** panel. You can make an immediate status change or schedule a statue change for a future date and time. You can schedule a single status change or schedule the complete lifecycle of the images. The image statuses are:  \n  \n * `available`: The image can be used to create an instance.  \n  \n * `deprecated`: The image is still available to use to provision and instance. Using the `deprecated` status can discourage use of the image before the status changes to `obsolete`.  \n * `obsolete`: The image is not available to use to provision an instancce.  \n  \n * Schedule complete lifecycle: You can schedule both the `deprecated` and `obsolete` status changes at the same time.  \n  \n You can move back and forth between the three statuses. Only the statuses you can change to are displayed. You can schedule status changes by using calendar date and time or number of days. The obsolescence dates must always be after the deprecation date.|
| Delete | Delete the custom image.  \n  \n  If you want to delete a custom image in a private catalog, see [Deleting a custom image in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=ui#deleting-private-catalog-custom-image-vpc). |

## Listing custom images by using the CLI
{: #custom-images-list-cli}
{: cli}

You can list all of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom images in your region by using the command-line interface (CLI).

To list all custom images by using the CLI, use the **`ibmcloud is images`** command. Custom images are private to the account where they are created, so the `--visibility` option is `private`.

```sh
ibmcloud is images --visibility private
```
{: pre}

```
{: codeblock}

## Exporting a custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}
{: #custom-image-export-to-cos}

You can export a custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. Later, you might want to copy the image to a new region by importing it again, or you might want to extract the image outside of VPC for use in a different location, such as on premises. Charges might be incurred for storing images in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Billing](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-billing).

### Prerequisites
{: #custom-image-export-to-cos-prereqs}

To export a custom image, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* You need an IAM role that includes the `is.image.image.export` and `is.image.image.operate` actions. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for VPC Infrastructure Services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started).
* You need an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance created. You must also create an authorization for the Image Service for VPC to access {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} with the Writer service access role. For more information, see [Granting access to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} to import and export images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-object-storage-prereq).
* You need IAM access to write to the bucket where you plan to export an image. For more information, see [Assigning access to an individual bucket](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-iam-bucket-permissions).

If the image that is being exported is deleted while an export job is in progress, the image status is set to `deleting`. The export job is allowed to complete before deletion of the image completes. When the image deletion is complete, its export job history is not available. You can use [Activity Tracker](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-at_events#events-images) events for the export job to determine its final status.
{: note}

### Exporting a custom image by using the UI
{: #custom-image-export-to-cos-ui}
{: ui}

To export a custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, complete the following steps.

1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Images**.
2. On the **Custom images** tab, click the name of the custom image that you want to export.
3. On the image details page, click the **Actions** menu and select **Export**.
4. On the **Export custom image panel**, you can optionally specify a name for the export job. The name is used, along with the image name, to construct the name of the exported object in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. If you do not specify a name, a name is automatically generated.
5. Select the file format for exporting. Valid file formats are **QCOW2** and **VHD**. If the custom image is an encrypted image, **QCOW2** format is required.
6. Specify the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance and bucket where you want to export the custom image. Alternatively you can specify the CRN for the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket where you want to export the image.
7. Click **Export custom image**.

### Exporting a custom image by using the CLI
{: #custom-image-export-to-cos-cli}
{: cli}

You can export an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} by using the command-line interface (CLI).

To export a custom image by using the CLI, use the **ibmcloud is image-export-job-create** command. Specify the name or ID of the custom image to export by using the `IMAGE` variable. You can specify a name for the export job with `NEW_NAME`. You can also specify the file format for exporting the image, either `qcow2` or `vhd`. The `qcow2` format is the default file format and is the required format if the custom image is encrypted. Additionally, specify the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} `BUCKET` where you want to export the custom image.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-export-job-create IMAGE [--name NEW_NAME] [--format qcow2 | vhd] --bucket BUCKET
```
{: pre}

The following example exports a custom image with the ID of `72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479`. The export job is named `my-export-job`. The file format for exporting the image is `qcow2`. The {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket where the image exported is named `my-bucket`.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-export-job-create 72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479 --name my-export-job --format qcow2 --bucket my-bucket
```
{: pre}

For more information, see [ibmcloud is image-export-job-create](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#image-export-job-create) in the VPC CLI reference page.

### Exporting a custom image with the API
{: #custom-image-export-to-cos-api}
{: api}

You can export an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} by using the application programming interface (API).

To export a custom image by using the API, use [Create an image export job](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-image-export-job).

For the`$image_id` variable, specify the ID of the custom image that you want to export. You can optionally specify a meaningful `name` for the image export job. In this example, the export job name is `my-image-export`. For the `storage_bucket` `name` subproperty, specify the name of the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket where you want to export the custom image. In this example, the bucket name is `bucket-27200-lwx4cfvcue`. Alternatively, you can use the `crn` subproperty to specify the CRN of the bucket.

```sh
curl -X POST \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/images/$image_id/export_jobs?version=2022-11-21&generation=2" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token" \
-d '{
  "name": "my-image-export",
  "storage_bucket": {
    "name": "bucket-27200-lwx4cfvcue"
  }
}'
```
{: codeblock}

## Viewing and managing custom image export history
{: #custom-image-export-job-history}

You can view the custom image export history to see details such as the export job name, status, target bucket in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} object name that is assigned, the date that the export job started, and if the export job is complete, the completion date.

You can also delete a completed image export job. Or you can delete (and cancel) an in-progress image export job if you have an IAM role that includes the `is.image.image.export` action.

When you delete an image export job, it is removed only from the export history. The exported image file is not removed from the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket. You must manage files that are stored in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} interfaces.
{: important}

Finally, you can rename an image export job. Renaming the image export job does not change the name of the object that is created in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.

## Sharing a custom image to a private catalog by using the UI
{: #sharing-custom-image-private-catalog-ui}
{: ui}

You can share an existing {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image to an existing private catalog. If you don't already have a private catalog, see [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui).

The **Share image to private catalog** action is not available for the following images:
* The image is already shared with a private catalog. An image in a private catalog can exist in only one version within one product offering in one private catalog. You must remove the image from the version it is in first before that image can be shared in a different version.
* The image is encrypted.
* The image is not an x86 image.

To share a custom image to a private catalog, complete the following steps.

1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Images**.
1. On the **Custom images** tab, click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) and select **Share to catalog**.
1. On the **Share image to private catalog** page, select a **Private catalog** from the list of available private catalogs.
1. Enter a version number in **Software version**.
1. Click **Create catalog offering** to share the image to the private catalog.
1. After the image is created, click **Validate image**.

This process shares only the custom image to the private catalog. The validation process occurs within the private catalog. Clicking **Validate image** takes you to a new page and from this screen, you can start with [Step 3: Validate the virtual server image in Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui#catalog-vsivpc-review-images) to complete the validation process.

To make an immediate status change using Terraform, use the [`ibm_is_image_deprecate`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_image_deprecate){: external} or [`ibm_is_image_obsolete`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_image_obsolete){: external} resource commands. use one of the following examples. For the `name` variable, specify the name of the custom image for the status change.

You can make an immediate status change only if a future status change is not scheduled. To remove a scheduled status change, see [Remove a scheduled custom image lifecycle status change by using Terraform](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-custom-images&interface=terraform#schedule-ilm-reset-status-change-terraform). After you remove the scheduled status change, you can make an immediate status change.

* Change image lifecycle status to `deprecated`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     encrypted_data_key = "eJxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0="
     encryption_key     = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx:key:dxxxxxx-fxxx-4xxx-9xxx-7xxxxxxxx"
   }
   resource "ibm_is_image_deprecate" "example" {
     image               = ibm_is_image.example.id
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

* Change the image lifecycle status to `obsolete`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     encrypted_data_key = "eJxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx0="
     encryption_key     = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/6xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx:key:dxxxxxx-fxxx-4xxx-9xxx-7xxxxxxxx"
   }
   resource "ibm_is_image_obsolete" "example" {
     image               = ibm_is_image.example.id
   }
   ```

To schedule a status change, use one of the following examples.

For the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` attribute, specify a date in the ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`) date and time format.

* `YYYY` is the four digit year
* `MM` is the two digit month
* `DD` is the two digit day
* `T` separates the date and time information
* `hh` is the two digit hours
* `mm` is the two digit minutes
* `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` is the UTC time zone

Thus, the date of 30 September 2023 at 8:00 PM in the North American Central Standard Time Zone (CST) would be `2023-09-30T20:00:00-06:00`

When scheduling the date and time, you can't use your current date and time. For example, if it is 8:00 AM on June 12, then the scheduled date and time must be after 8:00 AM on June 12. If you define both the `deprecation_at` and `obsolescence_at` dates and times, the `obsolescence_at` date must be after the `deprecation_at` date and time.

* Schedule a status change to `deprecated`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     deprecation_at     = "2023-11-28T15:10:00.000Z"
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

* Schedule a status change to `obsolete`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     obsolescence_at    = "2023-11-28T15:10:00.000Z"
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

   If you want to change the `deprecation_at` and `obsolescence_at` date and time entries, you can run these commands again. The previous dates and times are replaced with the new dates and times.

## Remove previously scheduled custom image lifecycle status using Terraform
{: #schedule-ilm-reset-status-change-terraform}
{: terraform}

To remove any scheduled status change, update the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` attributes to `null`. This attribute change removes the date and time from the image and the image is no longer scheduled for that status change.

* To change an image from `deprecated` to `available`, change the `deprecation_at` property to `null`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     deprecation_at       = null
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

* To change an image from `obsolete` to its previous state, change `obsolescence_at` to `null`. If the image previously contained a value other than `null` for `deprecation_at`, then this attribute change removes the `obsolete` state and changes it back to `deprecated`. If the previous state was `available`, meaning the image was moved from `available` directly to `obsolete`, then this attribute change moves from `obsolete` back to `available`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     obsolescence_at    = null
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

* To change an image that has both the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` properties set back to `available`, you must update both the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` attributes.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_image" "example" {
     name               = "example-image"
     href               = "cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd"
     operating_system   = "ubuntu-16-04-amd64"
     deprecation_at     = null
     obsolescence_at    = null
   }
   ```
