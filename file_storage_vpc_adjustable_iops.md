# Adjusting IOPS for a zonal file share
{: #file-storage-adjusting-iops}

For zonal file shares, you can increase or decrease IOPS to meet your performance needs. Adjust IOPS by specifying a different IOPS tier profile (IOPS are adjusted within the selected profile), custom profile, or dp2 profile. The process of adjusting the IOPS causes no outage or lack of access to the storage.
{: shortdesc}

Billing for an updated share is automatically updated. The prorated difference of the new price is added to the current billing cycle. The new full amount is then billed in the next billing cycle.

You can't modify the IOPS value of regional file shares that are created with the `rfs` profile. However, you can adjust the bandwidth value to finetune the share's performance.

## Adjustable IOPS concepts
{: #fs-adj-iops-concepts}

You can adjust IOPS for your zonal file shares to tailor performance to meet your requirements.

For example, you might find that an application scaled such that a lower-tier storage profile is now a performance bottleneck. You can change the performance characteristics of the existing file share by increasing IOPS by selecting a higher IOPS tier (for example, 3 IOPS/GB tier to 5 IOPS/GB tier).

In another scenario, you might want to initially set your file storage at a higher 10 IOPS/GB performance level to expedite a data upload. After the upload completes, you can reset storage to 5 IOPS/GB for normal operations. Also, you might want to increase your file share's IOPS during peak times for your application and decrease IOPS during off-peak hours.

By using this feature, you can:

* Adjust IOPS when you're using the [dp2](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#dp2-profile) or the [custom IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#fs-custom). The IOPS range is based on the file share size. For example, for a file share that's 25 GB, you can increase IOPS anywhere in the range 100-1,000 IOPS with a custom profile. If you later [increase the size of a file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-expand-capacity) to the next highest band, you can increase the IOPS again.

* Adjust IOPS from an IOPS tier profile to the dp2 or the custom profile. In this case, the file share size restricts the IOPS range that you select. 
   - For example, if you're adjusting IOPS for file share with a 3 IOPS/GB profile and it's 12,000 GB, you can adjust the IOPS by using a custom or dp2 profile. It's possible because both support a share size of 12,000 GB. 
   - If the file share size was greater than 16,000 GB, the custom profile would not support adjusting IOPS, but the dp2 profile would because it supports share sizes to 32,000 GB. The IOPS tier maximum sizes are 32,000 GB for 3 IOPS/GB, 9,600 GB for 5 IOPS/GB, and 4,800 GB for 10 IOPS/GB. 
   
   When you move from a tiered profile to a custom or dp2 profile, billing is update based on the specified IOPS.
   {: important}

* Adjust IOPS up or down by selecting a different [IOPS tier](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#fs-tiers). IOPS is adjusted within the tier. The degree to which IOPS can be increased is determined by the maximum that is allowed by the file share's [IOPS tier profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles). You can adjust IOPS for an IOPS tier based on share size or select the next profile that allows for increased performance.

   The maximum IOPS for a file share for a 3 IOPS/GB tier profile is 96,000 IOPS. All other profiles are capped at 48,000 IOPS. For 96,000 IOPS to be realized, a single file share must be accessed by multiple virtual server instances. A single file share that is accessed by one instance is limited to 48,000 IOPS.
   {: note}

* Adjust IOPS from a custom profile to an IOPS tier profile. Again, you're restricted to which IOPS tier profile you can select by the file share size. When you move from a custom profile to any tiered profile, billing is updated, and the IOPS is adjusted according to the profile.

To adjust a file share's IOPS, the file share must be in a _stable_ state. Your user authorization is verified before IOPS is adjusted.

You can use the UI, the CLI, the API, or Terraform to adjust IOPS. You can adjust the file share's IOPS multiple times up to its maximum limit or reduce IOPS to its minimum limit.

You can monitor the progress of your file share's IOPS change from the UI or CLI. You can also check the [Activity tracking events](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-at_events) to verify that the IOPS were adjusted.

## Limitations
{: #adjustable-iops-limitations-file}

The following limitations apply.

* To adjust IOPS, the file share must be in a _stable_ state.
* A [dp2 profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&nterface=ui#dp2-profile) can expand to the maximum allowed by the dp2 band. You can't switch dp2 IOPS bands unless you increase the file share size and then move to a higher band.
* For a file share created with an [IOPS tier profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui#fs-tiers) to increase or decrease IOPS, select a different profile for the file share size. If the file share size exceeds that of the new IOPS tier profile, you can't change the profile.
* A [custom IOPS profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#fs-custom) can expand to the maximum allowed by the custom band. You can't switch custom bands unless you increase the file share size and then move to a higher band.
* Adjusting IOPS by moving between profiles is restricted by the file share size.
* When you use a custom or dp2 profile, IOPS can be adjusted multiple times until the maximum or minimum limit is reached.
* The maximum IOPS for a file share for all profiles is [96,000 IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui#fs-tiers). For 96,000 IOPS to be realized, a single file share must be accessed by multiple virtual server instances. A single file share in an instance is limited to 48,000 IOPS.

## Adjusting IOPS in the console
{: #adjust-vpc-iops-ui-file}
{: ui}

Follow these steps to adjust IOPS by selecting a new IOPS tier or custom IOPS band:

1. Go to the list of file shares. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../icons/vpc.svg) **> Storage > File storage shares**. By default, file shares display for all resource groups in your region.

2. In the **File shares for VPC** list page, click the name of a file share to see its details.

3. On the file share details page, locate **Profile** and click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") or use the **Actions** menu and select **Edit IOPS profile**. Volumes must be attached to a virtual server instance for these actions.

4. In the side panel, adjust IOPS as follows:

   * For an IOPS tier, select a different tier from the menu. For example, you might have a 3 IOPS/GB general-purpose profile that you want to increase to a 5 IOPS/GB profile.

   * For a custom IOPS or dp2 profile, the current IOPS value is shown and file share size. Enter a new IOPS value within the allowable range for that size.

5. Review the estimated monthly order summary for your geography and new pricing.

6. If you're satisfied, click **Save and continue**. Your new IOPS allocation is realized when you restart the instance.

## Adjusting IOPS from the CLI
{: #adjust-vpc-iops-cli-file}
{: cli}

### Adjusting IOPS for a Custom or dp2 profile
{: #adjust-iops-cli-file}

From the CLI, use the `share-update` command with the `--iops` property to indicate the new IOPS size for a custom or dp2 profile. The IOPS that you indicate must be within the range for the size of the file share. For more information, see the [dp2](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#dp2-profile) or the [Custom IOPS profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#fs-custom).

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).

### Adjusting IOPS by specifying a different IOPS tier profile
{: #adjust-profile-cli-file}

These instructions are for the previous generation of file share profiles (general purpose, 5-iops, 10-iops, or custom). New file shares can be provisioned with only the dp2 profile. To access the latest features, you must change the IOPS profile of your share to dp2.
{: deprecated}

From the CLI, use the `ibmcloud is share-update` command with the `--profile` property and indicate the name or href of the IOPS tier profile.

The following example changes a 3 IOPS/GB profile to a 5 IOPS/GB profile. In this case, the file share can't exceed 9,600 GB to move to the higher profile.

```sh
ibmcloud is share-update my-file-share --profile tier-5iops

## Adjusting IOPS with the API
{: #adjust-vpc-iops-api-file}
{: api}

You can adjust IOPS for existing data file shares by calling the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) API.

### Adjusting IOPS for the dp2 or the custom profile
{: #adjust-iops-api-file}

Make a `PATCH /shares` request and specify the `iops` property to adjust the IOPS within the allowable range for a custom pr dp2 profile.

You can't update the name of the file share and adjust IOPS in the same `PATCH /shares` request. Make two `PATCH /shares` requests.
{: note}

The following example shows an increase of 100 IOPS to 3,000 IOPS for a 100 GB file share based on a 100 - 499 custom profile. The IOPS range for this custom band is 100 - 6,000 IOPS. For more information about available IOPS ranges, see [File storage profile overview](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=api).

```sh
curl -X PATCH \
 "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id?version=2023-08-086&generation=2" \
 -H "Authorization: $iam_token" \
 -d '{
      "iops": 3000
    }'
```
{: codeblock}

The file share status shows `updating` while the IOPS is being adjusted. The current IOPS is shown until you restart the instance. In the following example, IOPS value is adjusted from 100.

```json
{
   "created_at": "2023-08-08T22:58:49.000Z",
   "crn": "crn:[...]",
   "encryption": "provider_managed",

    .
    .
    .
	"status": "updating",
    .
    .
    .
}
```
{: codeblock}

When the IOPS expansion completes, restart the instance. The new value is displayed, and the file share status is `stable`.

### Adjusting IOPS by specifying a different IOPS tier profile
{: #adjust-profile-api-file}

These instructions are for the previous generation of file share profiles (general purpose, 5-iops, 10-iops, or custom). New file shares can be provisioned with only the dp2 profile. To access the latest features, you must change the IOPS profile of your share to dp2.
{: deprecated}

Make a `PATCH /shares` request and specify the `profile` property and indicate the name or href of the IOPS tier profile.

The following example changes a 3 IOPS/GB profile to a 5 IOPS/GB profile. In this case, the file share can't exceed 9,600 GB to move to the higher profile.

```sh
curl -X PATCH \
 "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id?version=2023-07-18&generation=2" \
 -H "Authorization: $iam_token" \
 -d '{
      "profile": "5iops-tier"
    }'
```

## Adjusting IOPS with Terraform
{: #adjust-vpc-iops-terrafom-file}
{: terraform}

You can adjust IOPS for existing data file shares in Terraform.

### Adjusting IOPS for a Custom or dp2 profile
{: #adjust-iops-terraform-file}

To modify the performance level of a file share, use the `ibm_is_share` resource and provide the IOPS value that you want. When you specify the IOPS value, make sure it is within the performance range for the size of the file share. For more information, see [dp2 file storage profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles#dp2-profile).

When it is applied, the following example updates the share performance to 5000 IOPS.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "my-new-share"
  size    = 200
  iops    = 5000
  profile = "dp2"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
}
```
{: codeblock}

### Adjusting IOPS by specifying a different IOPS tier profile
{: #adjust-profile-terraform-file}

To modify the performance level of a file share with an IOPS tier profile, use the `ibm_is_share` resource and specify a different IOPS tier. When it is applied, the following example updates the share performance to 5000 IOPS.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "my-share"
  size    = 220
  profile = "tier-5iops"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
}
```
