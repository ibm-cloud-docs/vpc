# Connecting to z/OS virtual server instances
{: #vsi_is_connecting_zos}

A z/OS virtual server instance is typically a private backend infrastructure component that must never be directly accessed from the outside world. Even environments that are used for development, testing, or demonstration must follow good practices for logical isolation.
{: shortdesc}

To learn how to use subnets to securely isolate and control traffic to backend infrastructure such as a z/OS virtual server instance, you can refer to the following tutorials:

- [Public front end and private backend in a Virtual Private Cloud](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-public-app-private-backend)
- [Securely access remote instances with a bastion host](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-secure-management-bastion-server)
- [About client-to-site VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview)

After you connected to the VPC network by using the client-to-site VPN server, you can access the z/OS virtual server instance by using the private IP address.

## Before you begin
{: #vsi_is_connecting_zos_prereq}

Make sure that you locate the private IP address before you connect to the z/OS instances. Private IP addresses are IP addresses that are provided by the system and are only reachable within the VPC network. You can find the private IP address of your z/OS virtual server instance under the *Reserved IP address* column on the console after the instance is created successfully.

If your z/OS virtual server instance is created by using the z/OS dev and test stock image, you can refer to the [Reserved configurations](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wazi-aas/1.0.0?topic=vpc-configurations-in-zos-stock-images){: external} table to add additional ports to the security group of your instance.


## Step 1. Configuring the password
{: #configure-password}

Before you can log in to a z/OS virtual server instance, you must change the password for the default user ID `ibmuser`.

If you are using your z/OS Wazi aaS custom images, you do not need to configure the password. You can safely ignore this step and then connect to the z/OS virtual server instance instead. 
{: note}

1. Log in to the z/OS UNIX shell environment by using your SSH private key and the default user ID. The `vsi ip address` in the following code snippets represent the private IP address of your z/OS virtual server instance.

   ```sh
   ssh -i <path to your private key file> ibmuser@<vsi ip address>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You receive a response similar to the following example. When prompted to continue connecting, type `yes`.
   
   ```json
   The authenticity of host 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)' can't be established.
   ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
   Warning: Permanently added 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
   ```
   {: screen}

2. Use the `tsocmd` command to configure password phrases for the z/OS instance. Replace `YOUR PASSWORD PHRASE` with your own password phrase.

   ```bash
   tsocmd "ALTUSER IBMUSER PHRASE('YOUR PASSWORD PHRASE') NOEXPIRE RESUME"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You must follow the syntax rules for password phrases that are listed in [Assigning password phrases](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=users-assigning-password-phrases){: external}.
   {: important}               
                                                                
   For more information about the commands, see [tsocmd - Run a TSO/E command from the shell (including authorized commands)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=scd-tsocmd-run-tsoe-command-from-shell-including-authorized-commands){: external} and [ALTUSER (Alter user profile)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=syntax-altuser-alter-user-profile){: external}.

## Step 2. Getting connected
{: #getting-connected-zos}

You can interact with your z/OS virtual server instance with the following approaches.

### Using TN3270 terminal emulator
{: #using-terminal-emulator}

You can use the TN3270 terminal emulator to log on to the Time Sharing Option/Extensions (TSO/E). The default port for the secured TN3270 is `992` and you need to provide a self-signed certificate-authority (CA) certificate as a parameter to have a secured connection to the 3270 emulation program. You can find your self-signed CA certificate in a file that is called `common_cacert` in the home directory of the `IBMUSER` user ID in z/OS UNIX System Services.

- For macOS, Linux, and Windows system where the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) client is installed, you need to transfer the `common_cacert` file before you connect to the secured telnet port and run the following commands:

   ```sh
   scp ibmuser@<vsi ip address>:/u/ibmuser/common_cacert <my local dir>/common_cacert
   c3270 -cafile <my local dir>/common_cacert -port 992 <vsi ip address>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
 
   If the file is not in the correct format, you need to convert it to ASCII format.
   {: note}

- For Windows, you need to import the self-signed CA cert into Windows first and then create the IBM Personal Communications (PCOMM) to read the CA cert from the truststore in Windows. Complete the following steps:

    1. Transfer the `common_cacert` file from the z/OS system to your workstation.
  
    2. Open **Internet Options** in your workstation.
  
    3. Under **Content**, select **Certificates**.
  
    4. Select **Import** to open the Certificate Import Wizard page and click **Next**.
  
    5. Click **Browse** to select the `common_cacert` file and click **Next**.
  
    6. Under the Certificate Store page, select **Place all certificates in the following store** and click **browse** to select the **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities**, and then click **Next**.
  
    7. On the Completing the Certificate Import Wizard page, click **Finish**.
  
    8. After you transfer the CA cert to the truststore successfully, you need to create a secure session in PCOMM. Under the **Host Definition** tab of the **Link Parameters** configuration, enter the IP address or the hostname of your z/OS virtual server instance with port `992`.
  
    9. Under the **Security Setup** tab of the **Link Parameters** configuration, check the **Enable Security** box. 

    The default user ID is `IBMUSER` and the password is the one you configured in the previous step. Then, you can interact with the z/OS in the TSO native mode, by using the Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF), or by using z/OS UNIX shell and utilities. For more information, see [Interacting with z/OS: TSO, ISPF, and z/OS UNIX interfaces](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=concepts-interacting-zos-tso-ispf-zos-unix-interfaces){: external}.

    The unsecured port `23` for 3270 connection is closed. You must use the secured port `992`.
    {: important}

    * The VSI server certificate only contains the private IP address information of the z/OS virtual server instance. 
    * Optionally, you can use the IP address of the VSI as part of the `accepthostname` argument when connecting over a floating IP address. For example:
      ```text
      c3270 -cafile <my local dir>/common_cacert -port 992 -accepthostname <vsi ip address>  <floating ip>
      ```
      {: codeblock}

### Using IBM Host On-Demand
{: #using-host-on-demand}

If you want to import the CA certificate by using IBM Host On-Demand, run the following commands:

1. Download the certificate file from the z/OS system.
   
    ```sh
    scp ibmuser@<vsi ip address>:/u/ibmuser/common_cacert ./Downloads/common_cacert
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Import the downloaded certificate. Use a recognizable alias.
   
    ```sh
    keytool -importcert -alias <alias> -file ./Downloads/common_cacert -keystore /Applications/HostOnDemand/lib/CustomizedCAs.jks -storepass hodpwd 
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. Check what certificates have been imported.
   
    ```sh
    keytool -list -keystore /Applications/HostOnDemand/lib/CustomizedCAs.jks -storepass hodpwd
    ```
    {: codeblock}

### Using the web browser to access z/OSMF
{: #using-web-browser}

You can use the web browser to access the IBM z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF). For example, access the url `https://<vsi ip address>:10443/zosmf/LogOnPanel.jsp`. 

For more information about the z/OSMF, see [IBM z/OS Management Facility](https://www.ibm.com/products/zos/management-facility){: external}.

When you launch z/OSMF, browser security warnings are displayed because z/OS virtual server instances are created with TLS certificates that are signed by an internal self-signed root certificate.
    {: note}

### Using serial console from IBM Cloud UI
{: #using-serial-console}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to connect to a serial console and monitor the progress of the IPL within the console. 

To connect to the serial console, you need to be assigned `Operator` (or greater) and `Console Administrator` roles for the virtual server instance in {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM). Otherwise, the serial console is disabled.
{: note}

Follow these steps to connect to a console by using IBM Cloud UI.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/infrastructure){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Virtual server instance**.
   
2. In the **Virtual server instances for VPC** list, click the overflow button of the instance that you need to access, then click **Open Serial Console**. Alternatively, on the instance details page, click **Action** on the upper right then click **Open Serial Console**.

3. If the serial console is being used, you will be prompted to confirm whether to force open a session. This will disconnect the other user's session.

4. Enter the credentials following the prompts to log in to your instances.

5. Use the **Ctrl + L** key combination to open a new z/OS Master Console, where you can issue four commands `start`, `stop`, `ipl`, and `oprmsg` for z/OS virtual server instance operations.

For more information, see [Accessing virtual server instances by using VNC or serial consoles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_console). The VNC console is not supported on z/OS virtual server instances.

### Using SSH private key through a floating IP address
{: #using-ssh-key}

You can use the SSH private key through a floating IP address to connect the z/OS UNIX shell environment. 

However, you might want to unbind your floating IP from your z/OS virtual server instance for security considerations and use a [bastion host](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-secure-management-bastion-server) or [client-to-site VPN server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview) for all connections. The default secured port is 22. For more information about the floating IP address, see [Reserving a floating IP address](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console#reserving-a-floating-ip-address)

If you want to access another z/OS virtual server instance that is created by using a different SSH key, you must ask the instance owner to add your SSH public key into the `authorized_keys` file on that z/OS virtual server instance. For more information about the `authorized_keys` file, see [Format of the authorized_keys file](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=daemon-format-authorized-keys-file){: external} and [Configuring new users to access your z/OS virtual server instance](#new-sshkey-zos).

## Step 3. Configuring new users to access your z/OS virtual server instance
{: #new-sshkey-zos}

To allow others to access your z/OS virtual server instance by using their own z/OS user IDs and own SSH keys after the instance is created, you must create each user profile and add each SSH public key into the `authorized_keys` file on the z/OS virtual server instance.

1. You can use one of the following methods to create a new z/OS user ID in the RACF (Resource access control facility):
  
    * Issuing the `ADDUSER` command.
    * Enrolling the user through the TSO/E Information Center Facility (ICF) panels. For more information about administering the Information Center Facility, see [z/OS TSO/E Administration](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=tsoe-zos-administration){: external}.

   Here is an example of using the `ADDUSER` command to create a user profile. Suppose you want to create a user profile for user Steve H., a member of Department A. You want to assign the following values:
    * `STEVEH` for the user ID
    * `DEPTA` for the default connect group
    * `DEPTA` for the owner of the STEVEH user profile
    * `R3I5VQX` for the initial password
    * `Steve H.` for the user's name

   Steve H. does not require any of the user profile segments except TSO. The TSO segment values that you want to set to start with are `123456` for the account number and `PROC01` for the logon procedure.
   {: note}

   To create a user profile with these values, you can run the following commands:
   
    ```sh
    ADDUSER STEVEH DFLTGRP(DEPTA) OWNER(DEPTA) NAME('Steve H.')
        PASSWORD(R315VQX) TSO(ACCTNUM(123456) PROC(PROC01))
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Then, you can use one of the following options to add new SSH public keys into the `authorized_keys` file.

    * Use the linux command such as `ssh-copy-id -i <new-ssh-public-key-file> ibmuser@<vsi ip address>` to upload new SSH public keys on your local file system into the z/OS virtual server instance. For more information, see [ssh-copy-id for copying SSH keys to servers](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/copy-id){: external}.

    * Log in to the z/OS virtual server instance, use the z/OS Unix System shell command such as `cat <new-ssh-public-key-file> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to concatenate the new SSH public key into the `authorized_keys` file. For more information, see [cat - Concatenate or display files](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=descriptions-cat-concatenate-display-files){: external}.

    * Use the [Zowe CLI](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-installcli.html){: external} to connect to the z/OS virtual server instance, then create a CLI profile and add new SSH public keys into the `authorized_keys` file. For more information about the Zowe CLI profiles, see [Creating Zowe CLI profiles](https://ibm.github.io/zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin/cdp-Creating-Zowe-CLI-profiles){: external}.


For more information about the `authorized_keys` file and z/OS user profiles, see [Format of the authorized_keys file](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=daemon-format-authorized-keys-file){: external} and [Summary of steps for defining users](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=users-summary-steps-defining){: external}.


## Next steps
{: #next-manage-vsi-zos}

After you connected to your virtual server instance, you can [manage your instance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-virtual-server-instances).
