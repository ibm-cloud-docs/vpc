# VPC Instance Metadata API change log
{: #metadata-api-change-log}

Read the API change log to learn about updates and improvements to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) [Instance Metadata API](/apidocs/vpc-metadata). The change log lists changes that are ordered by the date they were released. Changes to existing API versions are designed to be compatible with existing client applications.
{: shortdesc}

By design, new features with backward-incompatible changes apply only to version dates on and after the feature's release. Changes that apply to older versions of the API are designed to maintain compatibility with existing applications and code. If backward-incompatible changes require non-trivial client code changes to use an API version, the API change log might provide links to instructions, tips, or best practices for updating client code.
{: note}

Some changes, such as new response properties or new optional request parameters, are considered backward compatible. Other changes, such as new required request parameters, are not considered backward compatible. To avoid disruption from changes to the API, use the following best practices when you call the API:

- Catch and log any `4xx` or `5xx` HTTP status code, along with the included `trace` property
- Follow HTTP redirect rules for any `3xx` HTTP status code
- Consume only the resources and properties your application needs to function
- Avoid depending on behavior that is not explicitly documented

## Upcoming changes
{: #upcoming-changes-metadata}

In an upcoming release, the **Access tokens** and **Certificates** methods will no longer be part of the [Virtual Private Cloud Instance Metadata API](/apidocs/vpc-metadata). Those methods will be included in a new **Virtual Private Cloud Identity API**. The paths will change from `/instance_identity` to `/identity`. Prepare for behavior changes that could lead to API client and workflow failures by starting to update the design for your automation, even if you won't be able to test it yet.

**Virtual network interface protocol state filtering mode.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc-metadata#get-virtual-network-interface) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc-metadata#list-virtual-network-interfaces) virtual network interfaces, the new `protocol_state_filtering_mode` property denotes the protocol state filtering mode used for this virtual network interface. If the value is `auto`, protocol state packet filtering is enabled or disabled based on the virtual network interface's `target` resource type. For more information, see [Virtual network interfaces protocol state filtering](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#28-may-2024) in the VPC API change log.

This release introduces the following updates for accounts that have been granted special approval to preview these features:

**Confidential computing capabilities.** If [Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc) are enabled on an instance or instance template, you can view the new `confidential_compute_mode` property, which indicates that confidential compute mode is enabled for this virtual server instance. For more information, see the [VPC API change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#28-may-2024).

**Secure boot capabilities.** If [secure boot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-confidential-computing-with-secure-boot-vpc) is enabled on an instance or instance template, you can view the new `enable_secure_boot` property when [retrieving an instance](/apidocs/vpc-metadata#get-instance). This property indicates if secure boot is enabled for this virtual server instance. For more information, see the [VPC API change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#28-may-2024).

**Reservations for Virtual Servers for VPC.** You can now purchase a [capacity reservation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc) for a specified instance profile in a specified zone. When [retrieving an instance](/apidocs/vpc-metadata#get-instance), the new `reservation` and  `reservation_affinity` properties indicate the reservation and reservation affinity policy in effect for the virtual server instance. The new `health_state` property indicates the instance's overall health state, while an accompanying `health_reasons` property indicates the reason for any unhealthy health states, such as a failed reservation.

For more information, see the [API change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#26-march-2024) and [Provisioning reserved capacity for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-provisioning-reserved-capacity-vpc).
