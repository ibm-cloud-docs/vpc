# Creating an instance group for auto scaling
{: #creating-auto-scale-instance-group}

With Auto Scale for VPC, you can create an instance group to scale according to your requirements. Based on the target utilization metrics that you define, the instance group can dynamically add or remove instances to achieve your specified instance availability.
{: shortdesc}

If you are going to use a custom image in a private catalog, you must first create a service-to-service policy to `globalcatalog-collection.instance.retrieve` before you can create the instance group. For more information, see [Using a custom image in a private catalog with an instance group](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-catalog-image-instance-group&interface=ui).

## Auto scale for VPC
{: #auto-scale-vpc}

With Auto Scale for VPC, you can improve performance and costs by dynamically creating virtual server instances to meet the demands of your environment. You set scaling policies that define the average utilization that you want to achieve for metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage. The policies that you define determine when virtual server instances are added or removed from your instance group.

As an example, imagine that the fictitious company, Acme Web Retailer, sets up an instance group for auto scaling. They define that they always want to maintain a minimum of three instances and a maximum of seven instances. They create a dynamic scaling policy for CPU usage with their specified average utilization for instances at 70%. They set an aggregation window of 10 minutes, so the instance group manager monitors each instance for 10 minutes before it calculates the average utilization. If adjustments are needed to meet the target utilization across instances, the instance group manager provisions or reclaims more instances as needed.

Auto scale uses the following computation to determine how many instances are running at any time:

```text
Σ(Current average utilization of each instance)/target utilization = membership count
```

If Acme Web Retailer has four virtual server instances that are running when the aggregation window elapses, the formula looks like this: _VSI1 + VSI2 + VSI3 + VSI4 / 70% = membership count_. CPU utilization for the four running instances is 80%, 70%, 65%, and 85%, so the following computation takes place:

```text
80% + 70% + 65% + 85% / 70% = 4.29
```

Based on this calculation, the instance group manager rounds **4.29** up to **5** and provisions another instance. Now Acme Web Retailer has a total of five instances and maintains their specified average CPU utilization across the instances in the group.

![Image showing an instance that is being added to an instance group](images/VPC_Autoscaling_Docs.png "Image showing an instance that is being added to an instance group after computation"){: caption="Auto scale instance group adds new instance" caption-side="bottom"}

When an instance group scales up to create an instance, a subnet is selected randomly from the subnets that are defined for the instance group. When an instance group scales down to remove instances, it uses a first in first out (FIFO) strategy. The oldest instances are deleted first. If at any time an instance in the instance group fails, it is replaced with a new instance.

You can configure your instance group with a load balancer to balance incoming requests across instances. With a load balancer, you can configure specific health checks for the pool members that are associated with instances in your instance group. If an instance fails health checks, a new instance is created in the instance group to replace the failed membership. When the new instance is available, the instance that failed health checks is deleted.

The monitoring service reflects the same health information for instances that health checks access.

## Setting up auto scale with the UI
{: #setting-up-autoscale-overview}
{: ui}

Before you can create an instance group, you need to [create an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-using-the-ibm-cloud-console).
{: important}

To create an instance group for auto scale, you must complete the following tasks.

1. Create an instance template that is used to provision instances in your group.
2. Create an instance group in a single region that is made up of like virtual server instances.
3. Choose a scaling method (static or dynamic) and create scaling policies.

### Creating an instance template
{: #creating-instance-template}

An instance template is required before you can create an instance group for auto scaling. The instance template defines the
details of the virtual server instances that are created for your instance group. For example, specify the profile (vCPU and
memory), image, attached volumes, and network interfaces for the image template. All of the virtual server instances that are
created for an instance group use the instance template that is defined in the instance group.

All resources that are defined in an instance template must all be in the same resource group as the instance group.
{: tip}

To create an instance template, complete the following steps.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Instance templates**.
2. Click **New instance template** and enter the information that is in Table 1.
3. Click **Create instance template** when the information is complete.


{{site.data.content.create-instance-template-table}}

**Important:** Instance groups don't support instance templates that have the following configurations:

- Secondary network interfaces aren't supported. Only one primary network interface for an instance template is supported in an instance group.
- A primary IP address or floating IP address that is assigned to the primary interface isn't supported.

When you create an instance template, validation steps are performed to make sure that you can use this template to provision a virtual server instance.

### Creating an instance group
{: #creating-instance-group}

An instance group is a collection of like virtual server instances. You define how many instances to maintain in the group.
You can set a static number of instances or choose to dynamically scale instances according to your requirements.

If you want to include a load balancer for your instance group to balance incoming requests across instances and configure specific health checks, you must create the load balancer before you create the instance group. For more information, see the following topics:

- [About application load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers-about) and [Creating an IBM Cloud Application Load Balancer for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers)
- [About network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-network-load-balancers), [Creating an IBM Cloud Network Load Balancer for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer), and [Creating an IBM Cloud Private Network Load Balancer with routing mode for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vnf)

For more information about health checks for load balancer pools, see the following topics:

- [Working with health checks (ALB)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-alb-health-checks)
- [Working with health checks (NLB)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-health-checks)

Not all network load balancer offerings support integration with instance groups. Before attaching an instange group to a network load balancer pool, ensure that the `instance_groups_supported` property of the [load balancer detail](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) is `true`.
{: important}

1. Make sure that you have the required IBM {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM) permissions to create an instance group. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for VPC Infrastructure Services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started&interface=ui).
2. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Instance groups**.
3. Click **New instance group** and enter the information in Table 2.
4. If you want to create dynamic scaling policies as part of instance group creation, see [Creating scaling policies](#creating-scaling-policies). You can also [add policies later](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-instance-group#creating-target-policies) after you create your instance group.
5. Click **Create instance group** when the information is complete.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name  | A name is required for your virtual server instance. |
| Resource group | Select a resource group for the instance. |
| Region | Select the location where you want your virtual server instance to be created. |
| Placement group | Select a placement group for the instance. If you add a placement group, the instance is placed according to the placement group policy. For more information, see [About placement groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-placement-groups-for-vpc). |
| Subnets | Select the subnets where you want to create your instance group. To maximize the availability of your applications, select subnets in different zones. For the best performance of an auto scale instance group, ensure that you use a subnet size of 32 or greater. |
| Use a load balancer | Select this checkbox if you plan to use a load balancer to balance incoming requests across instances in your instance group. The load balancer must already be configured, attached to the subnets that you select for this instance group, and have at least one back-end pool. |
| Instance template |  Select the instance template that you want to use for provisioning the virtual server instances in your auto-scale instance group. All virtual server instances in the group are provisioned with the same instance template. |
| Scaling method | Select whether you want to use a dynamic or static scaling method. With the dynamic scaling method, instances are added or removed based on the metric targets that you specify. With the static scaling method, you can specify a fixed number of instances that you always want to maintain. |
| Instance group size | For a static group, enter the number of instances that you want to constantly have in this instance group. For a dynamic group, enter the minimum and maximum number of instances for your group. The number of instances scale automatically within that range based on the target metrics that you define. |
| Aggregation window (seconds) | For a dynamic group, this value determines the time period that the instance group manager monitors each instance and determines the average utilization. |
| Cooldown period (seconds) | For a dynamic group, the cooldown period is the time in seconds to pause further scaling actions after scaling takes place. |

### Creating scaling policies
{: #creating-scaling-policies}

For the dynamic scaling method, you define certain metrics (like CPU utilization percent) and the target utilization that you want to achieve for that metric. Together, the metric and the average target utilization, determine when your instance group needs to dynamically add or remove virtual server instances from your group.

To add scaling policies, complete the following fields on the **New instance group for VPC** page. If you need to add policies after your instance group is already created, see [add policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-instance-group#creating-target-policies).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Metric type | Select the metric type that you want to associate with a target utilization value to use for adding or removing instances from your group. You can choose one of these metrics: CPU utilization (%), RAM utilization (%), Network in (Mbps), Network out (Mbps). You can define more than one target metric policy, but only one policy for each type of metric. |
| Average target utilization | Specify the average utilization that you want to achieve for the metric that you select. This target value defines when the instance group manager needs to scale up instances or scale down instances in your group. At the end of each aggregation window, the instance group manager adds the current utilization of each instance and divides it by this target utilization value to determine the membership count. |

   ```
   {: screen}

   For the best performance of an auto scale instance group, ensure that you use a subnet size of 32 or greater.

   If you don't have one available, you can create a subnet by using the `ibmcloud is subnet-create` command. For more information about creating a subnet, see [IBM Cloud VPC CLI reference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#subnet-create).

1. List the available images for creating your instance template.
   You can create an instance by using a stock image, a custom image from your account, or an image that was shared with your account from a private catalog. Run one of the following commands based on the image that you plan to use.

   - Select a stock image or image from your account for your instance.

    To list all available images, run the following command:

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is images
    ```
    {: pre}

    Deprecated images do not include the most current support.
    {: tip}

    Now select image `ibm-debian-11-11-minimal-amd64-4`. To get the image ID, run the following command:

    ```sh
    image=$(ibmcloud is images | grep -i "debian.*available.*amd64.*public" | cut -d" " -f1)
    ```
    {: pre}

    Save the image ID as a variable, which is used later to provision an instance.

   - Select an image shared from a private catalog for the instance

    To list all available images, run the following command.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud is catalog-image-offerings
    ```
    {: pre}

    This command returns both the `offering_crn` and the `offering_version_crn` for the available images. When you create an instance, you can either provision an instance from the private catalog image at the latest version in a catalog product offering by using the `offering_crn` or from a specific version in the catalog product offering by using the `offering_version_crn`.

    Save the `offering_crn` and `offering_version_crn`in variables, which is used later to provision an instance.

    ```sh
    offering_crn="crn:v1:bluemix:public:globalcatalog-collection:global:a/a1234567:0b322820-dafd-4b5e-b694-6465da6f008a:offering:136559f6-4588-4af2-8585-f3c625eee09d"
    offering_version_crn="crn:v1:bluemix:public:globalcatalog-collection:global:a/a1234567:0b322820-dafd-4b5e-b694-6465da6f008a:version:136559f6-4588-4af2-8585-f3c625eee09d/8ae92879-e253-4a7c-b09f-8d30af12e518"
    ```
    {: pre}

After you know these values, use them to run the `instance-template-create` command. In addition to the information that you gathered, you must specify a name for the instance.

The following example creates an instance template by using a stock image or a custom image from your account.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-template-create INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME VPC ZONE_NAME PROFILE_NAME SUBNET --image-id IMAGE_ID
```
{: pre}

For example, if you create an instance template that is called _my-instance-template_ in _us-south-1_, use the _bx2-2x8_ profile, with a custom image `_r008-54e9238a-feaa-4f90-9742-7424cb2b9ff1_` your `instance-template-create` command would look similar to the following sample.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-template-create my-instance-template r006-680c56cb-7fbb-41e6-833b-029beb7b6ba3 us-south-3 bx2-2x8 0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999 --image-id r008-54e9238a-feaa-4f90-9742-7424cb2b9ff1
```
{: pre}

Where:

   - `INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME` is _my-instance-template_
   - `VPC` is _r006-680c56cb-7fbb-41e6-833b-029beb7b6ba3_
   - `ZONE_NAME` is _us-south-3_
   - `PROFILE_NAME` is _bx2-2x8_
   - `SUBNET_ID` is _0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999_
   - `--image_ID` is _r008-54e9238a-feaa-4f90-9742-7424cb2b9ff1_

For this example, you see a response similar to the following output **Note:** The following response varies depending on what values you use.

### Creating an instance group
{: #creating-instance-group-cli}

After you have your instance template in hand, your next step is to create an instance group. Before you can run the `instance-group-create` command, you must specify a name for the instance group and determine values for the command options, such as what instance template you want to use.

If you want to include a load balancer for your instance group to balance incoming requests across instances and configure specific health checks, you must create the load balancer before you create the instance group. For more information, see

- [About application load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers-about) and [Creating an IBM Cloud Application Load Balancer for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers).
- [About network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-network-load-balancers) and [Creating an IBM Cloud Network Load Balancer for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer).

For more information about health checks for load balancer pools, see

- [Working with health checks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-alb-health-checks).
- [Working with health checks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-health-checks).
{: important}

Gather the following information.

|    Instance group details  |       Description                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Instance template | ID of the instance template that you created in the previous task |
| Subnet IDs | Comma-separated IDs of subnets that you must select from the `ibmcloud is subnets` command in the previous task |
| --membership-count | Number of members in the instance group |
{: caption="Required instance group details" caption-side="bottom"}

After you know these values, use them to run the `instance-group-create` command. In addition to the information that you gathered, you must specify a name for the instance group.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-create INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME --instance-template INSTANCE_TEMPLATE --subnet-ids IDS --membership-count MEMBERS
```
{: pre}

For example, if you create an instance group that is called _my-instance-group_ with instance template ID _72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_ and _1_ member initially, your `instance-group-create` command would look similar to the following sample.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-create my-instance-group --instance-template 72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479 --subnet-ids 0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999,0767-173bn4aa-060b-47e7-am45-b3395a593897 --membership-count 1
```
{: pre}

Where:

   - `INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME` is _my-instance-group_
   - `--instance-template` is _72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_
   - `--subnet IDs` are _0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999_ and _0767-173bn4aa-060b-47e7-am45-b3395a593897_
   - `--membership-count` is 1 initially

For this example, you see a response similar to the following output:

### Creating an instance group manager
{: #creating-instance-group-manager-cli}

Now you can create an instance group manager so that you can apply your scaling policies in the next and final task. Before you can run the `ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-create` command, you need to determine values for the command options, such as what instance group you want to manage.

Gather the following information.

|    Instance group manager option  |       Description                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| INSTANCE_GROUP | ID of the instance group you created in the previous task |
| --max-members | The maximum number of members in a managed instance group; range 1 - 100 |
{: caption="Required instance group manager details" caption-side="bottom"}

After you know these values, use them to run the `instance-group-manager-create` command.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-create INSTANCE_GROUP --max-members MAX_MEMBERS
```
{: pre}

For example, if you create an instance group manager with instance group ID _72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_ and options --max-members = _20_, your `instance-group-manager-create` command would look similar to the following sample.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-create 72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479 --max-members 20
```
{: pre}

Where:
   - `INSTANCE_GROUP` is _72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_
   - `--max-members` is _20_

For this example, you see a response similar to the following output:

```text
ID                     r006-bcf54494-f63a-41a7-8368-9f7d002c9020

### Creating scaling policies
{: #creating-scaling-policies-cli}

Now you're ready to take full advantage of autoscaling! For the dynamic scaling method, you define certain metrics like CPU utilization percent and the target utilization that you want to achieve for that metric. Together, the metric and the average target utilization determine when your instance group needs to dynamically add or remove virtual server instances from your group. This target value defines when the auto scale manager needs to scale up instances or scale down instances in your group. At the end of each aggregation window, the auto scale manager adds the current utilization of each instance and divides it by the target utilization value that you specify to determine the membership count.

Before you can run the `group-manager-policy-create` command, you need to specify an instance group and a group manager, then specify values for the metric type and the average target utilization.

Gather the following information.

|    Instance group manager policy option  |       Description                |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| INSTANCE_GROUP | ID of the instance group |
| MANAGER | ID of the manager |
| --metric-type | The type of metric to be evaluated:  cpu (utilization percent), memory (utilization percent), network_in (Mbps), network_out (Mbps) |
| --metric-value | The metric target value to be evaluated |
{: caption="Required instance group manager policy details" caption-side="bottom"}

Use the following commands to determine the required information for creating a new instance template.

1. List the available instance groups for creating your scaling policy.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud is instance-groups
   ```
   {: pre}

   For this example, you see a response similar to the following output:
   ```text
   ID                                          Name                     Status           Instances
   72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479        my-instance-group        healthy          1
   72271a2e-d6c7-64b6-99c7-ac7426ew3495        my-other-instance-group  healthy          1

   ```
   {: screen}

2. List the available instance groups managers for creating your scaling policy.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud is instance-group-managers 72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479
   ```
   {: pre}

   Where:
   - `INSTANCE_GROUP` is _2251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_

   For this example, you see a response similar to the following output:

   ```text
   ID                                          Status    Aggregation Window   Cooldown   Max Membership Count   Min Membership Count
   72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb3        enabled   90                   300        20                     1

   ```
   {: screen}

After you know these values, run the following command to create a scaling policy.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-policy-create INSTANCE_GROUP MANAGER --metric-type METRIC_TYPE --metric-value METRIC_VALUE
```
{: pre}

For example, if you create a scaling policy with instance group ID _72251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_ and manager ID _72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb3_ with options --metric-type _cpu_ and --metric-value = _50_, your `ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-policy-create` command would look similar to the following sample.

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-policy-create 2251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479 72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb3 --metric-type cpu --metric-value 50
```
{: pre}

Where:
   - `INSTANCE_GROUP` is _2251a2e-d6c5-42b4-97b0-b5f8e8d1f479_
   - `MANAGER` is _72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb3_
   - `--metric-type` is _cpu_
   - `--metric-value` is _50_

For this example, you see a response similar to the following output:

```text
ID             r006-5f5c1127-da5c-4c7a-a8ae-9a539b56fa56
Metric Type    cpu
Metric Value   50
Policy Type    target

```
{: screen}

The response indicates that the auto scale manager needs to scale up the number of instances in your group when the average CPU utilization reaches 50 percent. Likewise, the auto scale manager also scales down the number of instances in your group when the average CPU utilization drops to less than 50 percent.

For more examples of the `ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-policy-create` command, see the [VPC CLI reference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#instance-group-manager-policy-create).

You can define more than one target metric policy, but only one policy for each type of metric. Need more help? You can always run `ibmcloud is instance-group-manager-policy-create --help` to display help for creating a scaling policy.
