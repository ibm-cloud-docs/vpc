# Activity Tracker events
{: #at-events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

## Network resources

### DNS resolution binding events
{: #events-dns-resolution-bindings}

This VPC feature is available only to accounts with special approval to preview this feature.
{: preview}

New events:

| Resource  | Action  | Description  |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| DNS resolution binding | `is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.create` | Creates a DNS resolution binding. Generates events for both hub VPC and DNS-shared VPCs. |
| DNS resolution binding | `is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.update` | Updates the name of a DNS resolution binding. |
| DNS resolution binding | `is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.delete` | Deletes a DNS resolution binding. Generate events for both hub VPC and DNS-shared VPCs. |
| DNS resolution binding | `is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.read` | Gets details of a DNS resolution binding. |
| DNS resolution binding | `is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.list` | Lists DNS resolution bindings. |
{: caption="Table 3. Actions that generate events for DNS resolution bindings" caption-side="bottom"}

Although the DNS resolution binding is created or deleted by the DNS-shared VPC authorized user, the system is actually creating or deleting the DNS resolution binding objects for both the hub VPC and DNS-shared VPCs. Therefore, the system also generates the Activity Tracker event for both hub and DNS-shared VPCs.
{: note}

Existing events include a new attribute:

`is.vpc.vpc.{create,update}`
:    Includes a `dns` property and its object value in request data.

`is.vpc.vpc.{read,list}`
:    Includes a `dns` property and its object value in response data.

`is.endpoint-gateway.endpoint-gateway.{create,update}`
:    Includes an `allow_dns_resolution_binding property` and its boolean value in both request and response data.

`is.endpoint-gateway.endpoint-gateway.{list,read}`
:    Includes an `allow_dns_resolution_binding property` and its boolean value in response data.

## Supported locations
{: #at-supported-locations}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full}} support is available for the Dallas location.

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by VPC resources are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch#launch_cloud_ui).

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_iam_analyze}

Refer to the following information when you are analyzing events:

- Activity Tracker actions are set to `read` for both the GET and LIST calls, for example, `is.instance.instance.read`. However, for the LIST calls, the `target.name` field is set to `*`, whereas for the GET calls, it is set to the name of the resource.

- When a user triggers an instance action change, an Activity Tracker log is generated. The action is specified to one of the following valid action types: `start`, `stop`, and `reboot`.

- The `target` field contains information about the top-level resources, for example, VPC, subnets, and instances (virtual machine). For subresources, such as volume-attachments and security-group rules, their unique identifier can be found from the `responseData.responseURI` field. The mapping to the parent resources is reflected by the URI.

- For events that are related to volume-attachments, the ID of the volume that was attached can be found indirectly by getting the ID of the volume-attachment from the `target.responseURI` field (which also contains the instance ID), and by using that ID to query the corresponding `GET /instance/{instance_id}/volume-attachment/{volume-attachment-id}` API. The volume ID can be found from the response of the GET API call.

- For events that are related to Load Balancer requests, consider the following information:

    You can get more data in the `requestData.requestPath` field. You can find details about a subresource such as a listener ID or rule ID.

    When you create resources, you can get IDs from the `responseData.responseContent` field.

    For update actions, the original value is not included. You can do a read action to get the value before you run an update on the resource.

- The following fields for Bare Metal Servers for VPC AT events are changing between the Beta and LA releases:

   1) The `severity` field in Beta events is not consistent with general practice within VPC and is corrected in the LA release.

   2) The `target resourceGroupID` field in Beta events does not include the CRN prefix. This is corrected in the LA release.

   3) Some Beta events include array data. If the array is too large, the event isn't recorded. For LA, these events display an array element count rather than the actual data.

- Each time you open a console for a virtual server instance or bare metal server, two API calls are issued: the first one generates a console access token, the second one uses the generated token to open the console websocket.

   This API call generates two Activity Tracker events: `is.instance.console-access-token.create` and `is.instance.console.read`, or `is.bare-metal-server.console-access-token.create` and `is.bare-metal-server.console.read`.

   You cannot use `request id` to correlate console Activity Tracker events as each call generates a unique `request id`. Instead, you can use `initiator id` to correlate console events that are generated from API calls issued by the same user.

- You can find the detailed information and fields included in the requestData and responseData for the Bare Metal Servers for VPC AT events in the [API documentation](/apidocs/vpc/latest).
