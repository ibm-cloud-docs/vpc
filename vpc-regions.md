# Creating a VPC in a different region
{: #creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region}

A region is a specific geographical location where you can deploy apps, services, and other {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} resources. Regions consist of one or more zones, which are physical data centers that house the compute, network, and storage resources, with related cooling and power, for host services and applications. Zones are isolated from each other, which makes sure that no shared single point of failure within a region occurs.

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC service is regional. To allow for disaster recovery (DR), you must provide the ability for recovery by using failover to an alternative region, by establishing a VPC in one of our other regions.
{: note}

Virtual Private Cloud is available in the following {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} regions.

The Regional API (VPC) endpoint is automatically set by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI when you log in to a specific region.
{: note}

## Logging in to a specific region by using the CLI
{: #log-in-to-a-specific-region-using-the-cli}
{: cli}

When you log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can specify a region or choose it later. For example, to log in to the global API endpoint in the Dallas (`us-south`) region directly, run the following commands. These commands vary according to whether you have a federated account (SSO) or a non-federated account.

For a federated account,

```sh
ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com -r us-south --sso
```
{: pre}

For a non-federated account,

```sh
ibmcloud login -a https://cloud.ibm.com -r us-south
```
{: pre}

To choose the region later, do not specify the `-r <region>` parameter and the CLI prompts you to choose a region.

Example output:

```json

## Switch regions by using the CLI
{: #switch-regions-using-the-cli}
{: cli}

To get the latest status of the VPC regions, run the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is regions
```
{: pre}

To switch to a different region, run the `ibmcloud target -r <region>` command. For example, to switch to the Washington DC region, run the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud target -r us-east
```
{: pre}

To check your current location, run the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud target
```
{: pre}

## Switch regions by using the API
{: #switch-regions-using-the-api}
{: api}

To interact with the Regional VPC API by using REST, direct your request to the API endpoint that is associated with the region in which you want to create resources. The region's API endpoint is shown in the previous table. You also can find the endpoints that are associated with the regions by running the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is regions
```
{: pre}


For example, to get the list of VPCs in the `us-south` region, run the following command:

```curl
curl "https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/vpcs?version=$api_version&generation=2" -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}


## Get zones by using the CLI
{: #get-zones-using-the-cli}
{: cli}

To get the list of zones available for each region, run the command `ibmcloud is zones` in the target region. In the following example, the first command switches the target to `us-south` region. The second command lists the available zones.

```sh
ibmcloud target -r us-east; ibmcloud is zones
Switched to region us-east

API endpoint:      https://cloud.ibm.com
Region:            us-east
User:              test.user@ibm.com
Account:           Test Account (a1234567) <-> 1414935
Resource group:    No resource group targeted, use 'ibmcloud target -g RESOURCE_GROUP'
CF API endpoint:
