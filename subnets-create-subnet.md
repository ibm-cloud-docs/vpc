# Working with subnets in VPC
{: #subnets-configure}

Subnets help your network traffic travel more efficient paths from origin to destination. You can use access control lists (ACLs) with subnets to protect your resources within each subnet.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #subnets-prereqs}

Before you begin, you must be assigned one or more IAM access roles that include the following actions, depending on any listed conditions. You can check your access by going to **[Users](/iam/users) > User > Access**.

* `is.subnet.subnet.create`
* `is.public-gateway.public-gateway.operate`
    Required when `public_gateway` is specified
* `is.network-acl.network-acl.operate`

## Creating a subnet in VPC
{: #subnets-vpc-create}

You can create a subnet in VPC by using the console, CLI, or API.

If you use an IP range outside of the ranges [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918){: external} defines (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16) for a subnet, the instances attached to that subnet might be unable to reach parts of the public internet. If you plan to configure VPCs that use both non-RFC-1918 addresses and also have public connectivity (floating IPs or public gateways), make sure to use a custom route that contains the Delegate-VPC action.
{: tip}

### Creating subnets in VPC using the UI
{: #subnets-create-ui}
{: ui}

To create a subnet in your VPC instance, take the following steps:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}.
1. Select the **Navigation menu** ![Navigation menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) > **Network** > **Subnets**.
1. Click **Create +** on the Subnets for VPC list table.
1. In the Location section, provide the following information:
    * **Geography**: Indicate the general area where you want the subnet to be created.
    * **Region**: Indicate the region where you want the subnet to be created.
    * **Zone**: Indicate the zone where you want the subnet to be created.
1. In the Details section, provide the following information:
    * **Name**: Enter a unique identifier for the subnet, such as `my-subnet`.
    * **Resource group**: Select a resource group for the subnet.
    * **Tags**: Optionally, add any relevant tags to help group your subnets.
    * **Access management tags**: Optionally, add access management tags to resources to help organize access control relationships. The only supported format for access management tags is `key:value`. For more information, see [Controlling access to resources by using tags](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial).
    * **Virtual private cloud**: Select the VPC in which you want the subnet to be created.
    * **IP range selection**: The most efficient location for your IP range is calculated automatically. If you want to customize the IP range instead of accepting the default selection, select a different address prefix, change the number of addresses, or enter your IP range manually.
    * **Routing table**: Select which routing table that you want the new subnet to use.
    * **Subnet access control list**: Select which access control list you want the new subnet to use.
    * **Public gateway**: Indicate whether you want the subnet to communicate with the public internet by toggling the switch to **Attached**.
        Attaching a public gateway creates a [Floating IP](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fip-about) and incurs a cost.
        {: note}

1. In the Summary panel, click **Create subnet** to create the subnet.

### Attached resources tab
{: #subnets-attached-resources}
{: ui}

The **Attached resources** tab lists all resources attached to your subnet, and provides a method of creating and attaching new resources. You can create the following resources from this tab:

* Instances
* Bare metal servers
* Instance templates
* Instance groups
* Load balancers
* VPN gateways
* Virtual endpoint gateways
* VPN servers

Click **Create+** in the resource list table of the resource you want to create. You'll be taken to the respective create resource workflow where you can begin the process of creating the resource.

### Reserved IPs tab
{: #subnets-reserved-ip}
{: ui}

The **Reserved IPs** tab is a list of all reserved IPs associated with the subnet. For more information about Reserved IPs, see [Managing IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-ip-addresses&interface=ui).

### Creating subnets in VPC using the CLI
{: #subnets-create-cli}
{: cli}

To create a subnet by using the CLI, run the following command:


```sh

```
{: codeblock}





Where:

`SUBNET_NAME`
:    Name of the subnet.

`VPC`
:    ID or name of the VPC.

`--ipv4-cidr-block`
:    The IPv4 range of the subnet. This option is mutually exclusive with `--ipv4-address-count`.

`--acl`
:    The ID or name of the network ACL.

`--pgw`
:    The ID or name of the public gateway.

`--resource-group-id`
:    The ID of the resource group. This ID is mutually exclusive with `--resource-group-name`.

`--resource-group-name`
:    Name of the resource group. This name is mutually exclusive with `--resource-group-id`.

`--output`
:    Specify output format, only JSON is supported. One of: `JSON`.

`-q, --quiet`
:    Suppress verbose output.

### Viewing subnets in VPC using the UI
{: #subnets-view-ui}
{: ui}

After you have created a subnet, it appears in the Subnets for VPC list.

To view the details about a subnet in the list using the console, CLIck the link of the subnet in the **Name** column. The **Overview** tab shows the information you used in the subnet creation.

### Viewing subnets in VPC using the CLI
