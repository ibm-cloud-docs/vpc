# Why isn't the service route for my VPN server correct?
{: #troubleshoot-service-route-incorrect}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

For a VPN server, service routes are propagated to routing tables that have `VPN server` selected for the `Accepts routes from` attribute. These routes have names that are prefixed with `ibm-vpn-server-`.
{: shortdesc}

In rare cases, you might find that these service routes are incorrect. For example, the `Next hop` is not the same as the private IP of your VPN server. In these cases, traffic is broken even if you connected to the VPN server successfully.
{: tsSymptoms}

The VPN server service keeps monitoring the health of each VPN server. When a fault is detected, the service tries to recover the VPN server automatically. The recovery process might fail and cause inaccurate routes to remain.
{: tsCauses}
