# Creating replica file shares
{: #file-storage-create-replication}

Create a replica file share in the console, from the CLI, with the API, or with Terraform. Replica file shares can be created in another zone of the same metro region as the primary share's zone, or a zone of a different metro region in the same geography.
{: shortdesc}

The following table shows which metro regions can replicate with each other within each geography. 

| Americas | Europe  | Asia  |
|----------|---------|-------|
| - Dallas, TX / `us-south` \n - Sao Paulo / `br-sao` \n - Toronto / `ca-tor` \n - Washington, DC / `us-east` |  - Frankfurt / `eu-de` \n - London / `eu-gb` \n - Madrid / `eu-es`| - Osaka/ `jp-osa` \n - Sydney / `au-syd`\n - Tokyo / `jp-tok` |
{: caption="This table shows the metro regions that can replicate with each other in each geography. Every geography is a separate column." caption-side="bottom"}

The specified source file share must not have another replica already, and must not be a replica of another share.
{: requirement}

If you want to create a replica in another region, you need to establish service-to-service authorizations first. Both file service instances must belong to the same account. Cross-account replication is not supported. For more information, see [Establishing service-to-service authorizations for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-s2s-auth).
{: requirement}

Customers with special access to preview the new regional file share offering can use the **rfs** profile to create file shares with regional availability. When you create file shares with regional availability, data is automatically replicated throughout the region, so you don't need to set up replication pairs. Cross-regional replication of regional file shares is not supported in this release.
{: beta}

## Adding replication to a file share in the console
{: #fs-create-replica-ui}
{: ui}

You can create a replica of your file share from the list of all file shares or the file share details page. If you don't already have a source file share, provision one as described in [Create a file share and mount target in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create&interface=ui#fs-create-share-target-ui). When the file share appears as "stable" on the File storage shares for VPC page, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and click **Create replica**.

On the File share replica create page, review the source file share details, and complete the replica details.

1. Name - Provide a unique name for the replica share.
1. Replica location - The geography is preselected and cannot be changed. Select the metro (region) and zone in which the replica share is to be created. The UI presents the available options in the menu.
1. Resource group - Select the resource group from the list.
1. Tags - Optionally, specify [user tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-managing&interface=ui#fs-add-user-tags). The tags that you apply to the replica can be the same as or different from the source share's tags.
1. Profile - The `dp2` profile is preselected, even if the source file share is based on a profile from a previous release. Specify the maximum value for IOPS. It determines the performance that you get on the replica after you [perform a failover](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-failover).
1. Mount Targets - Optionally, create a mount target for the replica share. You can skip this step if you do not want to create a mount target now. Otherwise, click **Create**. You can create one mount target per VPC per file share. Depending on the [mount target access mode](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about&interface=ui#fs-mount-access-mode) of the share, the **Create mount target** form looks different.

   - If you selected security group as the access mode, enter the information as described in Table 2. This action creates and attaches a [virtual network interface](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about) to your mount target that identifies the file share with a reserved IP address and applies the rules of the selected Security group. This mount target supports encryption-in-transit and cross-zone mounting.

     | Field | Value |
     |-------|-------|
     | **Details** | |
     | Mount target name | Specify a mount target name. The name can be up to 63 lowercase alpha-numeric characters and include the hyphen (-), and must begin with a lowercase letter. You can later edit the name if you want. |
     | Zone | Zone is inherited from the file share (for example, Dallas 2). |
     | VPC | Select an available VPC. The list includes only those VPCs with a subnet in the selected zone. |
     | Subnet | Select a subnet from the list. |
     | **Reserved IP address** | Required for the mount target. The IP address cannot be changed afterward. However, you can delete the mount target and create another one with a different IP address. |
     | Reserving method | You can have the file service select an IP address for you. The reserved IP becomes visible after the mount target is created. Or, specify your own IP. |
     | Auto-release | Releases the IP address when you delete the mount target. Enabled by default. |
     | **Security groups** | The [default security group](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-updating-the-default-security-group) for the VPC is selected. You can use it or select another security group from the list. |
     {: caption="Values for creating a mount target." caption-side="top"}

   - If you selected VPC as the access mode, provide a name for the mount target and select a VPC from the list. This mount target can be used to mount the file share on any virtual server instance of the selected VPC in the same zone as the file share. Cross-zone mounting is not supported.

1. Sync frequency - Specify how often you want to synchronize changes from the primary file share to the replica share. The Summary shows the selections that you made. For **Frequency**, the options are hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or by `cron-spec` expression:
   * For hourly replication, enter a value in the range 0 - 60 to specify exactly how many minutes past the hour, every hour, every day the replication is to start.
   * For daily replication, specify the starting time in hours and minutes in Coordinated Universal Time. Enter a value between 00:00 and 23:59. For your convenience, the Coordinated Universal Time value is converted into your local time.
   * For weekly replication, specify the days of the week you want replication to run and the start time in Coordinated Universal Time. Enter a value between 00:00 and 23:59.
   * For monthly replication, choose a Day 1 - 28. For the start time, enter a value between 00:00 and 23:59.
   * If you specify a `cron-spec` expression, replications must be scheduled not less than 15 minutes. Enter the replication frequency in `cron-spec` format: minute, hour, day, month, and weekday. For example, to replicate every day at 5:30 PM you need to enter `30 17 * * *`.

1. Encryption
   * **Encryption in transit** is disabled by default. You can click the toggle to enable it. For more information about this feature, see [Encryption in transit - Securing mount connections between file share and host](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit). |
   * When you replicate to another zone of the same region, the encryption is inherited from the primary share. If you selected customer-managed encryption, the key management system is shown along with the root key. You can't encrypt a replica share with a different key.
   * When you replicate to another region, the encryption type (provider-managed vs customer-managed) of the replica must match the source share. However, it is not inherited from the source, and you must select a Customer Root Key for your replica if the source share is protected by customer-managed encryption.
  
   | Field | Value |
   |------|------|
   | Encryption | Select either {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. |
   | Encryption service instance | If you provisioned multiple KMS instances in your account, select the one that includes the root key that you want to use for customer-managed encryption. Ensure that [service-to-service authorizations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-s2s-auth) between the file service and the target KMS are in place. |
   | Key name | Select the root key within the KMS instance that you want to use for encrypting the share. |
   | Key ID | The field shows the key ID that is associated with the data encryption key that you selected. |

## Adding replication to file share from the CLI
{: #fs-create-replica-cli}
{: cli}

You can use the CLI to create a file share with a replica share in another zone, or region, or to create a replica share for an existing file share.

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).

### Creating a file share with a replica from the CLI
{: #fs-create-new-share-replica-cli}

When you use the `ibmcloud is share-create` command to create your share, you can create a replica share at the same time by specifying values for the options `--replica-share-name`, `--replica-share-profile`, `--replica-share-cron-spec`,`--replica-share-zone`. The cron-spec specifies the replication frequency, and you can schedule to replicate your data as often as 15 minutes. For more information about the command options, see [`ibmcloud is share-create`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#share-create).

In the following example, a share `my-source-file-share` is created in `us-south-1` with a replica file share `my-replica-file-share` in `us-south-3`. In this example, only one mount target is created for the source file share, but you can also create the mount target for the replica share by using the same JSON syntax with the `--replica-share-mount-targets` option as below.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is share-create --name my-source-file-share --profile dp2 --zone us-south-1 --size 40 --allowed-access-protocols nfs4 --atem ipsec,none --mount-targets '[{"access-protocol": "nfs4", "transit_encryption":"ipsec","name":"my-target1", "virtual_network_interface":{"name":"my-fs-cli-vni", "primary_ip":{"address":"12345","auto-delete":true,"name":"vni-target-1"},"security_groups":[{"id":"r006-bfa4dea5-3e09-4a76-90ef-cee3b840936b"}],"subnet":{"id":"0726-c5941a73-2e07-46e6-b0c8-db306259341f"}}}]' --replica-share-profile dp2 --replica-share-cron-spec '55 09 * * *' --replica-share-zone us-south-3  --replica-share-name my-replica-file-share --replica-share-mount-targets '[{"access-protocol": "nfs4", "transit_encryption":"ipsec","name": "my-target2", "virtual_network_interface":{"name":"my-fs-cli-vni-1", "primary_ip":{"address":"12345","auto-delete":true,"name":"vni-target-2"},"security_groups":[{"id":"r006-bfa4dea5-3e09-4a76-90ef-cee3b840936b"}],"subnet":{"id":"0726-c5941a73-2e07-46e6-b0c8-db306259341f"}}}]'

1. Create a replica share by running the `ibmcloud is share-replica-create` command in the target region. If you're not targeting the right region, use the `ibmcloud target -r REGION` command to switch the target region. Specify the source share by name, ID, or CRN. Provide values to define the zone where the replica file share is going to be created, and the profile of the replica share. Specify the replication schedule with a cron expression. If the source file share has `user_managed` encryption, you must provide the `--encryption_key`. The `--encryption_key` property must not be specified otherwise.

When you create a replica of a file share in another region, you must use the CRN of the source file share. If the source file share has `user_managed` encryption, you must provide the `encryption_key`. The `encryption_key` value must not be specified otherwise. See the following example.

   ```sh

## Adding replication to file share with the API
{: #fs-create-replica-api}
{: api}

You can programmatically set up replication by calling the `/shares` method in the [VPC API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share){: external} as shown in the following sample requests.

Before you begin, first set up the [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=api). For more information about the file shares VPC API, see the [VPC API reference](/apidocs/vpc/latest).

### Creating a file share with a replica with the API
{: #fs-create-new-share-replica-api}

When you create a file share, you can specify that a replica file share is also created in a different zone. Make a `POST /shares` request and specify the `replica_share` property to define the replica file share.

The following example creates the replica `test-replica-001` for the source share `source-share-001`. Mount targets, which are optional when you create a file share, are specified for the replica file share and source file share.

```sh
curl -X POST\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
-d '{
    "name": "source-share-001",
    "profile":{"name":"dp2"},
    "size":100,
    "iops": 400,
    "mount-targets":[{"vpc":{"id":"08669c86-4c8a-4bfa-8ddc-37071f955c52"}],
    "zone":{"name":"us-south-1"},
    "replica_share":{
  	   "name": "test-replica-001",
      "profile":{"name":"dp2"},
      "replication_cron_spec":"0 */5 * * *",
      "zone":{"name":"us-south-3"},
      "mount_targets": [
        {"virtual_network_interface": {"subnet": {"id": "2302-ea5fe79f-52c3-4f05-86ae-9540a10489f5"}}},
        {"vpc": {"id": "7ec86020-1c6e-4889-b3f0-a15f2e50f87e"}}],
      "resource_group": {},
      "allowed_transit_encryption_modes": "user_managed",
      "user_tags": ["string"]}}]
      }
    "resource_group": {},
    "allowed_transit_encryption_modes": "user_managed",
    "user_tags": ["string"]
   }'
```
{: pre}

### Creating a replica for an existing file share with the API
{: #fs-create-share-replica-api}

To add replication to an existing file share, you need to create a replica share in a different zone of your region. In the `POST /shares` request, specify the replica share's name and profile, and specify the `source_share` by either its name, ID, or CRN. Other required properties are the `zone`, and `replication_cron_spec`, which provides the replication schedule. You can schedule to replicate your data as often as 15 minutes.

The following example shows an API request that creates a replica share in the `us-south-1` zone. In this example, the source share is in another `us-south` zone and is identified by its ID.

```sh
curl -X POST \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares?version=2023-08-28&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token" \
  -d '{
  "source_share": {"id": "4aafd9c9-5555-4bdb-902d-d63d4dcf5adc"},
  "mount_targets": [],
  "name": "my-replica-share",
  "profile": {"name": "dp2"},
  "size": 100,
  "zone": {"name": "us-south-1"},
  "iops": 300,
  "replication_cron_spec": "00 05 * * 0",
  "resource_group": {"id": "6edefe513d934fdd872e78ee6a8e73ef"},
  "access_control_mode": "security_group",
  "allowed_transit_encryption_modes": "user_managed,none"
}'
```
{: pre}

When you create a replica of a file share in another region, you must use the CRN of the source file share. If the source file share has `user_managed` encryption, you must provide the `encryption_key`. The `encryption_key` value must not be specified otherwise.
{: requirement}

You can use the API to verify that the replication succeeded, is pending, or failed. Make a `GET /shares/{replica_id}` call. Look at the `latest_job` property. For more information, see [Verify replication with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=api#fs-verify-replica-api).
{: note}

## Adding replication to file share with Terraform
{: #fs-create-replica-terraform}
{: terraform}

You can use the `ibm_is_share` resource in Terraform to create a file share with replication, or update a file share to include replication. The following example creates a replica share in the `us-south-3` zone and associates it to the parent share that is specified by its ID `ibm_is_share.example.id`.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "my-replica1" {
  zone                  = "us-south-3"
  source_share          = ibm_is_share.example.id
  name                  = "my-replica1"
  profile               = "dp2"
  replication_cron_spec = "0 */5 * * *"
}
```
{: screen}

The following example creates a file share in `us-south-1` with a replica in `us-south-3`.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "my-replica" {
  zone    = "us-south-1"
  size    = 220
  name    = "my-share"
  profile = "dp2"
  replica_share {
    name                  = "my-replica"
    replication_cron_spec = "0 */5 * * *"
    profile               = "dp2"
    zone                  = "us-south-3"
  }
}
```
{: screen}

When you create a replica of a file share in another region, you must use the CRN of the source file share. If the source file share has `user_managed` encryption, you must provide the `encryption_key`. The `encryption_key` value must not be specified otherwise. See the following example.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "my-cross-regional-replica" {
  zone    = "us-east-1"
  source_share_crn = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:is:us-south-1:a/a1234567::share:r006-d8c8821c-a227-451d-a9ed-0c0cd2358829"
  encryption_key = "crn:v1:bluemix:public:kms:us-south:a/a1234567:1be45161-6dae-44ca-b248-837f98004057:key:3dd21cc5-cc20-4f7c-bc62-8ec9a8a3d1bd"
  replication_cron_spec = "5 * * * *"
  name    = "my-cross-regional-replica"
  profile = "dp2"
}
```
