# Setting up your API and CLI environment
{: #set-up-environment}

Before you can create an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) by using the API or CLI, set up your environment.
{: shortdesc}

## General prerequisites
{: #general-prerequisites}

1. Set up your account to access VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct){: external}.
2. Make sure that you have a public SSH key, which will be used to connect to the virtual server instance. For example, generate an SSH key on your Linux server by running the following command:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```
    {: pre}

   This command generates two files. The generated public key is in the `id_rsa.pub` file under an ``.ssh`` directory in your home directory, for example, ``.../.ssh/id_rsa.pub``.

   For more information, see [SSH keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys).

## CLI prerequisites
{: #cli-prerequisites-setup}
{: cli}

Before you can use the CLI to create your VPC, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI is not supported on LinuxONE (s390x processor architecture). However, you can install the CLI on another supported platform and use it with LinuxONE (s390x processor architecture) virtual server instances.
{: note}

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started){: external}.
1. Install the VPC CLI plug-in.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud plugin install vpc-infrastructure
   ```
   {: pre}

   The VPC CLI actions use the extension `is`. To learn how to use the CLI commands, you can run:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud is help
   ibmcloud is help vpc-create
   ibmcloud is help instance-create
   ```
   {: pre}

   To learn how to create resources by using the CLI, see [Creating VPC resources](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli).

### Accessing CLI through the VPC API private endpoint
{: #access_cli_through_api_private_endpoints}

To set the CLI to use the VPC API private endpoint, follow these steps:

If you need to download the IBM Cloud CLI and associated plug-ins, you must be able to access the public repository where they are located.
{: note}

1. Ensure that the core IBM Cloud CLI and VPC infrastructure service plug-in are updated to the latest version:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud update
   ibmcloud plugin update vpc-infrastructure
   ```
   {: pre}

1. To switch to API private endpoint mode, enter the following command:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud login -a private.cloud.ibm.com
   ```
   {: pre}

   Currently, API private endpoint mode supports only `us-south` and `us-east` regions.
   {: important}

## API prerequisites
{: #api-prerequisites-setup}
{: api}

Before you can use the API to create your VPC, you must get an IAM token, store the endpoint as a variable, and verify that you have access to the VPC API service.

The following examples use the `us-south` regional endpoint. To view additional API endpoints, see [Virtual Private Cloud API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#endpoint-url).
{: note}

### Step 1: Store your API key as a variable
{: #store-api-key-variable}

Run the following command to store the API key for your account in an environment variable. If you don't have an API key, see [Creating an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key){: external}.

```bash
apikey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
{: pre}

### Step 2: Get an IBM Identity and Access Management (IAM) token
{: #get-iam-token}

Run the following command to get and parse an IAM token by using the JSON processing utility [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/){: external}. You can modify the command to use another parsing tool, or you can remove the last part of the command if you prefer to manually parse the token.

```json
iam_token=`curl -k -X POST \
  --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey" \
  --data-urlencode "apikey=$apikey" \
  "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token"  |jq -r '(.token_type + " " + .access_token)'`
```
{: pre}

To view the IAM token, run ``echo $iam_token``. The result should look like this:

```sh
Bearer <your token>
```
{: screen}

The Authorization header expects the token to begin with "Bearer". If the result doesn't include "Bearer", update the `iam_token` variable to include it. These examples assume that "Bearer" is included in the `iam_token`.

You must repeat the preceding step to refresh your IAM token every hour because the token expires.
{: important}

### Step 3: Store the API endpoint as a variable
{: #store-api-endpoint-variable}

Run the following command to store the API endpoint in a variable so it can be reused later in your session.

Public endpoint:

```sh
vpc_api_endpoint="https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com"
 ```
{: pre}

Virtual private endpoint:

```sh
vpc_api_endpoint="https://us-south.private.iaas.cloud.ibm.com"
```
{: pre}

To verify that this variable was saved, run ``echo $vpc_api_endpoint`` and make sure that the response is not empty.

For supported endpoint regions, see [Endpoints available](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-service-endpoints-for-vpc).
{: note}

### Step 4: Store the API version as a variable
{: #store-api-version-variable}


Every API request must include the `version` parameter, in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Run the following command to store the version date in a variable so it can be reused in your session. For more information about setting the `version` parameter, see **Versioning** in the [Virtual Private Cloud API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#api-versioning).

```sh
api_version="2019-09-30"
 ```
{: pre}

To verify that this variable was saved, run ``echo $api_version`` and make sure that the response is not empty.

### Step 5: Verify that you have API access
{: #verify-api-access}

If you run into unexpected results, add the `--verbose` (debug) flag after the `curl` command to obtain detailed logging information. For more information about commonly encountered errors, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-troubleshooting-vpc).
{: tip}

* Call the GET Regions API to see the regions available for VPC, in JSON format. At least one object should return.

    You must send the `generation` parameter with every API request to specify which generation to use. For generation 2 virtual server instances, specify `generation=2`. For more information, see **Generation** in the [Virtual Private Cloud API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#api-generation-parameter).
    {: important}

    ```sh
    curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/regions?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
      -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
    ```
    {: pre}

* Call the GET Zones API to see all zones available for VPC in a particular region, such as `us-south`, in JSON format.

    ```curl
    curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/regions/us-south/zones?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
      -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
    ```
   {: pre}

* Call the GET Profiles API to see the profiles available for your virtual server instances, in JSON format. At least one object should return.

    Add ` | json_pp ` after the curl command to get a readable JSON string. The `json_pp` command is a JSON preprocessor that is typically installed by default on most Linux distributions.
    {: tip}

    ```curl
    curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/instance/profiles?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
      -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
    ```
    {: pre}

* Call the GET Images API to return the images available for your instances, in JSON format. At least one object should return.

   ```curl
   curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/images?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
     -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
   ```
   {: pre}

* Call the GET VPCs API to see any VPCs that were already created under your account, in JSON format.

    ```curl
    curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/vpcs?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
      -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
    ```
    {: pre}
