# Managing dedicated hosts and groups
{: #manage-dedicated-hosts-groups}

With a dedicated group and dedicated host created, you can manage your resources. You can create additional dedicated hosts,
provision new virtual server instances, or delete resources. You can also disable placement of new instances on
a dedicated host. Disabling placement of new instances is required if you need to delete a dedicated host.
{: shortdesc}

## Managing dedicated hosts
{: #manage-dedicated-hosts}

When you have a dedicated host created, you can create new virtual server instances on the host or disable placement of
instances on the host. If you no longer need a dedicated host or dedicated group, you can delete the resources.

To complete management tasks on your dedicated hosts, complete the following steps.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Dedicated hosts**.
2. On the Dedicated hosts tab of the Dedicated hosts for VPC page, click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the dedicated host that you want to manage. You can select from the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New instance | Create a virtual server instance on this dedicated host. |
| Disable placement | Temporarily prevent new virtual server instances from being provisioned on this host. No instances can be created on the host until placement is enabled again. You must disable placement before you can delete a dedicated host. |
| Enable placement | Indicate that new virtual server instances can be provisioned on this host. If placement has been disabled, it must be enabled before instances can be created on the host. |
| Delete | If you no longer need the dedicated host, you can delete it to permanently remove it from your account. Before you can delete the dedicated host, you must first delete any virtual server instances on the host. (Click the name of the dedicated host to access the Host detail page which displays instances on the host.) Then, you must disable the placement of any new virtual server instances on the dedicated host. This prevents any new instances from being created before you can delete the dedicated host. If the dedicated host is in a failed state, you can proceed directly with the delete action. |

## Viewing dedicated host details
{: #viewing-host-details}

You can view details about a dedicated host, such as the dedicated group that it's a part of, the ID of the host, the profile used to create it, and the remaining vCPU and memory on the host.

To view details about a dedicated host, complete the following step:

* On the **Dedicated hosts** tab of the Dedicated hosts for VPC page, click the name of the dedicated host about which you want to view details.

## Managing dedicated groups
{: #manage-dedicated-groups}

When you have a dedicated group created, you can create new dedicated hosts within the group. You can also create new virtual server instances on the hosts in the group. If you no longer need a dedicated group, you can delete it.

To complete management tasks on your dedicated groups, complete the following steps.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Dedicated hosts**.
2. Click the **Dedicated groups** tab on the Dedicated hosts for VPC page. Then click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the dedicated host that you want to manage. You can select from the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New instance | Create a virtual server instance in this dedicated group. The virtual server instance is provisioned on any dedicated host in the group that has space available. |
| New dedicated host | Create a dedicated host within this dedicated group.|
| Delete | If you no longer need the dedicated group, you can delete it to permanently remove it from your account. Before you can delete the dedicated group, you must first delete all dedicated hosts and virtual server instances within the group. |
{: caption="Actions available for dedicated groups" caption-side="bottom"}

## Viewing dedicated group details
{: #viewing-group-details}

You can view details about a dedicated group, such as the ID of the group, the profile family assigned to the group, and the hosts that are part of the group.

To view details about a dedicated group, complete the following step:

* On the **Dedicated groups** tab of the Dedicated hosts for VPC page, click the name of the dedicated group about which you want to view details.

### Determining capacity available in a group
{: #group-capacity}

On the Dedicated group details page, you can view the capacity of each dedicated host in the group that is currently allocated
for vCPU and memory. To determine space that is available for provisioning additional virtual server instances, complete the following steps:

1. On the Dedicated group details page, locate the existing hosts in the group under the heading, Dedicated hosts in *group*.
2. Check the vCPU allocated and Memory allocated columns to see what capacity is already used and how much is remaining on the individual hosts.
3. A virtual server instance cannot span more than one dedicated host, so the profile for an instance must be able to be provisioned on the remaining capacity of a single dedicated host.

### Dedicated host maintenance
{: #managing-dh-maintenance}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} performs periodic maintenance on the hosts and dedicated hosts.
Maintenance includes the live migration of the servers on the host or dedicated host. Host and dedicated host maintenance events can address load balancing, host failures, or other updates.

For more information, see [Host and dedicated host maintenance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cloud-maintenance#types-of-maintenance-host).
