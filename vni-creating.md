# Creating a virtual network interface
{: #vni-create}

A virtual network interface can be created without attaching to a target. Therefore, a virtual network interface can exist even when its target is removed.
{: shortdesc}

For example, within a VPC, your instance has a public IP address by which the instance can be reached from the internet, and a private IP address by which it can be reached from other instances in your VPC. You configured the instance with custom security group rules. If you delete the instance, the public IP address and security groups are detached. The private IP address is released and can be reserved again by another resource. If you want to create a new instance with the same public IP address, private IP address, and security groups as the deleted instance, you must reserve the private IP address again, and individually attach the previous public IP address and security groups.

You can use a virtual network interface to manage the IP addresses and security groups in a separate resource with a lifecycle that is independent of your instances. Create a virtual network interface with a private IP address, public IP address, and security groups. Then, create an instance with this virtual network interface. Later you can delete the instance, preserving the virtual network interface, and create a new instance with the same virtual network interface.

## Before you begin
{: #vni-prerequisites}

To create a virtual network interface, you must have the following prerequisites:

* A VPC instance
* A subnet in which to create a virtual network interface
* Make sure that you have the appropriate [IAM permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions#is.virtual-network-interface-roles). You must have IAM Administrator role permission to configure IP spoofing and infrastructure NAT.

Review [planning considerations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about#vni-planning) and [known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-known-issues) for virtual network interfaces.
{: important}

You can create a virtual network interface with the console, CLI, API, or Terraform.

## Creating a virtual network interface in the console
{: #vni-create-ui}
{: ui}

To create a virtual network interface in the console, follow these steps:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external} and log in to your account.
1. Select the **Navigation menu** ![Navigation menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) > **Network** > **Virtual network interfaces**.
1. On the Virtual network interfaces for VPC page, click **Create**.
1. In the Location section, edit the following fields, if necessary.
    * **Geography**: Indicates the geography where you want the virtual network interface created.
    * **Region**: Indicates the region where you want the virtual network interface created.
1. In the Details section, complete the following information:
   * **Name**: Enter a unique name for the virtual network interface, such as `my-virtual-network-interface`.
   * **Resource group**: Select a resource group for the virtual network interface.
   * **Tags**: (optional) Add tags to help you organize and find your resources. You can add more tags later. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).
   * **Access management tags**: (optional) Add access management tags to resources to help organize access control relationships. The only supported format for access management tags is `key:value`. For more information, see [Controlling access to resources by using tags](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial).
1. In the Network configuration section, complete the following information:
   * **Virtual private cloud**: Select the VPC in which you want to create your virtual network interface. If you need to create a VPC, click **Create VPC**.
   * **Subnet**: Select a subnet in which to create the virtual network interface. If you need to create a subnet, click **Create**.
   * **Allow IP spoofing**: Select the switch to enable or disable IP spoofing.
     * Disabling IP spoofing allows traffic to pass through the network interface, instead of ending at the network interface.
     * IP spoofing supports only virtual server instances and bare metal servers. File shares are not supported.
   * **Infrastructure NAT**: Select the switch to enable or disable infrastructure NAT.

     Infrastructure NAT is enabled when IP spoofing is enabled.
     {: note}

     * **Enabled** includes one floating IP address, and supports virtual servers, bare metal servers, and file shares.
     * **Disabled** supports multiple floating IP addresses only on bare metal servers. Virtual servers and file shares as virtual network interface targets are not supported.

         When disabled, the virtual server instance receives the traffic as it was sent by the peer, without NAT. The destination IP address is the floating IP address, and the bare metal server is responsible for performing the NAT.

   * **[Protocol state filtering mode](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about&interface=ui#protocol-state-filtering)**: Select a radio button to set the mode:

       * **Auto** (default): Filtering is enabled or disabled based on the virtual network interface's target resource.

          * Bare metal server (Disabled)
          * Virtual server instance (Enabled)
          * File share mount (Enabled)
       * **Enabled**: Forces the TCP connections to align with the [RFC793](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt){: external} standard and any packets to be allowed by corresponding security group rules and network ACLs.
       * **Disabled**: Permits packets to be allowed only by corresponding security group rules and network ACLs.
1. In the Primary IP section, make the following selections.
    * **Reserving method**: Select whether you want a primary IP address created for you, or if you want to specify one manually. If you specify your own, type an existing reserved IP address for your virtual network interface, or select one from the existing reserved IP list menu.
    * **Auto release**: Click the switch to enable or disable auto release for this virtual network interface.
1. In the Floating IPs section (optional), click **Attach**. In the side panel that appears, you can either select from the existing list of floating IP addresses, or select **Reserve new Floating IP** and complete the information that is requested.

    If a floating IP is attached, the virtual network interface will not be accepted as file share mount target. If infrastructure NAT is enabled, at most one floating IP can be attached.
    {: note}

1. In the Secondary IP section (optional), click **Attach**. Select a reserving method, and specify whether auto release is enabled.

    A virtual network interface with secondary IPs attached cannot be accepted as a file share mount target.
    {: note}

1. In the Security groups section, select at least one and at most five security groups to control traffic at the networking level. You can select security groups from the list, or create one by clicking **Create**. For more information about creating a security group, see [Creating security groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-security-groups).
1. Review the information in the Summary panel, and click **Create virtual network interface**.

## Creating a virtual network interface with the API
{: #vni-api-create}
{: api}

To create a virtual network interface with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your API environment [with the right variables](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#api-prerequisites-setup).
1. Store any additional variables to be used in the API commands; for example:

    * `version` (string): The API version, in format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

1. When all variables are initiated, create the virtual network interface:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST \
        "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/virtual_network_interfaces?version=$version&generation=2" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token" \
        -d '{
              "name": "my-virtual-network-interface",
              "primary_ip": {
                "address": "10.0.0.5"
              },
              "protocol_state_filtering_mode": "disabled",
              "security_groups": [
                {
                  "id": "be5df5ca-12a0-494b-907e-aa6ec2bfa271"
                },
                {
                  "id": "032e1387-71ba-4e83-b268-a53edf94af19"
                }
              ],
              "subnet": {
                "id": "032e1387-71ba-4e83-b268-a53edf94af19"
              }
      }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Creating a virtual network interface with Terraform
{: #vni-terraform-create}
{: terraform}

The following example creates a virtual network interface by using Terraform:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_virtual_network_interface" "is_virtual_network_interface_instance" {
  allow_ip_spoofing = true
  auto_delete = false
  enable_infrastructure_nat = true
  name = "my-virtual-network-interface"
  subnet = "<SubnetId>"
  protocol_state_filtering_mode = "auto"
}
```
{: codeblock}

For more information, see the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_virtual_network_interface){: external}.
