# Known issues for VPN servers
{: #vpn-client-vpn-limitations}

Known issues are identified bugs or unexpected behaviors that were not fixed before release, but werenâ€™t critical enough to delay it. These issues are communicated to you, often with workarounds, and are prioritized for resolution in the near term by the development team.
{: shortdesc}

Known issues for client-to-site VPN servers are as follows:

* Currently, only 2000 maximum active client connections are supported per server.
* MFA support is provided by IAM.
* Features not supported:
   * Integration with other identity providers, such as Active Directory and RADIUS
   * IPsec client-to-site VPN
   * More than two VPN appliances per VPN server
   * VPN server auto scaling
   * In-house, customized OpenVPN client
   * VPN client user self-service portal
* In client certificate authentication mode or client certificate and User ID/passcode authentication mode, authentication failure due to an invalid client certificate will not generate an activity track event
