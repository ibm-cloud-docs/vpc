# Working with listeners
{: #nlb-listeners}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.nlb_full}} (NLB) listeners are used to configure how the load balancer receives your traffic. The attributes that you can define on a listener are protocols, ports, and pools.

You can configure listeners when [creating a network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer), or later with the following procedure:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external} and log in to your account.

2. Select the **Navigation Menu** ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) > **Network** > **Load balancers**.

3. Click the NLB that you want to change.

4. On the network load balancer details page, click the front-end listeners tab, then select the listener that you want to edit.

5. Select the new options for your listener. You have the following options:

   * **Protocol**: The network protocol for the inbound customer traffic.
   * **Port**: The port that the load balancer receives your inbound customer traffic.
   * **Back-end pool**: The pool the load balancer distributes to the inbound customer traffic.

When you use the UI, you must create a pool before you create a listener. You cannot set the pool of an existing listener to empty.
