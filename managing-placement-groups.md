# Managing placement groups
{: #managing-placement-group}

With placement groups for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}, you can create policies for managing high availability workloads. You can specify a choice of placement policies for a group of provisioned instances. You can use these policies to influence the physical placement of select VPC virtual servers to meet certain workload demands.
{: shortdesc}

After the placement group is created, you can assign a selected virtual server instance or a group of virtual server instances to the placement group. When you provision these instances, the instance is then placed on a computer host in the designated zone for the instance based on the placement group strategy. You can use the same placement group for instances across multiple VPCs.

Placement groups can be managed with the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform. You can create extra placement groups, delete resources, and display the details of the placement groups, which are helpful when you assign placement groups to instances. Additionally, all existing placement groups can be listed and renamed if needed.

## Managing the placement group in the console
{: #managing-placement-groups-UI}
{: ui}

You can manage a placement group in your {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

To complete management tasks on your placement groups, complete the following steps.
1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Placement Groups**.
2. On the Placement groups for VPC page, click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the placement that you want to manage. You can select from the following actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Create | Create a placement group |
| Delete | If you no longer need the placement group, you can delete it to permanently remove it from your account. Before you can delete the placement group, you must first delete any virtual server instances that are assigned to the placement group.|
| Rename | Update the placement group name with a new name. |
{: caption="Actions available for placement groups" caption-side="bottom"}

The VPC must exist before you create a placement group. If the VPC is not created first, you receive an error when you create the placement group and the placement group is not created.

## Creating the placement group in the console
{: #creating-placement-group-UI}
{: ui}

You can create a placement group in your {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. A placement group must be created first before an instance can use it. After a placement group is created, an instance can be attached to it during provisioning.

Use the following steps to create a placement group:
1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Placement Groups**.
2. Click **Create** and enter the information in Table 1 on the New placement for VPC page.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Placement group name  | A unique resource name within the region is required for your placement group. If you don't specify a name, a name is generated and assigned to your placement group. |
| Resource group | Select the resource group that contains the account resources and users that you want to be able to access the placement group. For more information about resource groups, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs). |
| Region | The region of the placement group. |
| User tags | Keywords that are used for profile management. |
| Placement strategy | Host spread - All provisioned instances are placed on separate hosts that might be in the same rack.  \n \n Power spread - All provisioned instances are placed on different racks with separate power and network supplies. Each rack also contains dual power supplies from different sources.|
