# Troubleshooting virtual server instances for VPC
{: #troubleshooting-your-virtual-servers-for-vpc}

If you experience difficulties with your {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} instances, review the following possible causes.

## Permissions not set up in IBM Cloud
{: #troubleshooting-permissions-in-ibm-cloud}

Before you can create {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}, you need to set up the correct permissions in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. If your permissions are not correct, you can create a server and it shows `Pending` status, which quickly turns into `Failed` status. Make sure that the administrator of the account assigns you the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

## Servers are all in Unknown status
{: #troubleshooting-servers-unknown-status}

Most likely you do not have adequate permissions to view the server status. Make sure that you have the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

The Unknown status also might be caused by an expired IMS token. Run `bx sl init` again and rebuild the `ims_subject` with the new token. Make sure that you are passing in the `X-Subject-Token:$ims_subject` parameter in the request header.

## Error: 409 Conflict when you create an instance action
{: #troubleshooting-conflict-create-instance}

You can't create certain instance actions if the status of your instance is in conflict with another action. For example, if your instance status is `stopped`, and you try to create a `reboot` action, the system returns a 409 error.

| Status      | Action     | Conflict |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Running     | start      | yes      |
| Stopped     | Any action other than start  | yes      |
| Not running | pause      | yes      |
| Not running | reboot     | yes      |
| Not paused  | resume     | yes      |
| Paused      | Any action other than resume | yes      |

## Instance not responding to `instance-reboot` request
{: #troubleshooting-instance-not-responding}

If your instance is not responding to an `instance-reboot` request, you can try an `instance-reset` request. The `instance-reboot` request sends an OS-reboot request to the instance, while an `instance-reset` request performs a hard reset of the virtual server instance. You can think of the difference as typing "ctrl-alt-delete" on your computer's keyboard versus pressing the reset or power button. Remember that the `instance-reset` request takes longer to complete than the `instance-reboot` request.

## Why can't I add my SSH key?
{: #troubleshooting-cant-add-ssh-key}

If you try to add an SSH key to your account and get an error that the key can't be parsed, ensure there are no line breaks in the string. An SSH key is a continuous string of characters; sometimes line breaks are introduced when the SSH key is copied from a terminal. To avoid this issue, first paste your SSH key into a text editor and remove any line breaks. Then, copy the SSH key from the text editor and paste it into the VPC UI, CLI, or API.


## How do I reregister a RHEL virtual server instance?
{: #troubleshooting-reregister-RHEL-VSI}

If you see this error message:
```
This system is not registered with an entitlement server.
```
{: pre}

Your REHL virtual server instance was unregistered from the capsule server. To resolve this issue, run the `reregister-ng-rhel-vsi.sh` script to reregister the virtual server instance.

```

To run the script:
1. chmod +x reregister-ng-rhel-vsi.sh
2. ./reregister-ng-rhel-vsi.sh

*	capsule hostname
*	organization
*	activation key
*	profile name

## Can I configure nested virtualization on a virtual server instance?
{: #troubleshoot-enable-nested-virtualization}

Nested virtualization on virtual server instances is not a supported configuration.

## *z/OS - Experimental* How to remove broadcast messages when working with a z/OS virtual server instance?
{: #troubleshooting-broadcast-message-zos-VSI}

If you attach a block storage to your z/OS virtual server instance, a broadcast message similar to the following one shows on your display terminal every time when you log on to the instance by using a TN3270 connection.
```
...
Preparing attached block storage vde of size 15G
Attached block storage vde on address DE00
...
```
{: screen}

You can remove the broadcast message by using the following procedure:

1. Log on to the z/OS instance by [using a TN3270 terminal emulator](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_zos).

2. Enter `OPERATOR` on the command line and press Enter. The `OPERATOR` command along with its subcommands are used to regulate and maintain TSO/E from a terminal. For more details, see [OPERATOR command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=syntax-operator-command){: external}.

3. Enter the subcommand `SE LIST` and press Enter. The `SE LIST` subcommand lists all the broadcast messages.

   You might have to press Enter twice so that the subcommand takes effect.
   {: tip}

4. Enter the subcommand `SE NNNN,DELETE` to delete a particular message where `NNNN` is the message number of the broadcast message you want to delete. For example, `SE 002, DELETE`.

5. Enter the subcommand `SE LIST` to verify the message is deleted successfully.

6. Enter the subcommand `END` to terminate operation of the OPERATOR command.

## How do I resolve a SSH key error?
{: troubleshooting-ssh-keys-errors}

When you copy an SSH key from a terminal to add the key to your VPC, sometimes extra line breaks are introduced which cause a parsing error. To avoid this issue, first paste your SSH key into a text editor and remove any extra line breaks. Then, copy the SSH key from text editor and paste it into the VPC UI, CLI, or API.

## Why do I receive an SSH key permission denied error?
{: troubleshooting-ssh-key-permission-denied-error}

When you receive a SSH key permission denied error, your host might not be recognized as an authorized host. To add your host as a known host, run the following command in your terminal. Make sure that you replace `[sFTP]` with your host.

`ssh-keyscan -t rsa [sFTP] >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`

If you need more help, you can open a [support case](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar).
