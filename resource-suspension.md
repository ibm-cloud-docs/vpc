# Resource suspension
{: #resource-suspension}

Individual resources that violate {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} [terms of use](/docs/overview?topic=overview-terms){: external} are suspended. Potential resources that can be suspended include virtual server instances, instance groups, bare metal servers, VPN gateways, and VPN servers.
{: shortdesc}

While a resource is suspended, it cannot be used, modified, or deleted. For example, suspended bare metal servers and virtual server instances are powered off, and their configuration cannot be changed. Connections to VPN gateways and servers are disabled.

## Restoring access

To restore access to the affected resource, ask your account owner to review the support cases in the account.
