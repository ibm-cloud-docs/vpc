# Summary of data returned by the metadata service
{: #imd-metadata-summary}

Use the metadata service to access information about the instance, SSH keys, and placement groups. This topic provides a summary of this data by URI path and metadata key, and describes the metadata.
{: shortdesc}

The API response for each metadata type is presented in JSON format that contains metadata key:value pairs.

## Summary of metadata for instances
{: #imd-instance-summary}
