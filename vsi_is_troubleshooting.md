# Troubleshooting virtual server instances for VPC
{: #troubleshooting-your-virtual-servers-for-vpc}

If you experience difficulties with your {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} instances, review the following possible causes.

## Permissions not set up in IBM Cloud
{: #troubleshooting-permissions-in-ibm-cloud}

Before you can create {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}}, you need to set up the correct permissions in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. If your permissions are not correct, you can create a server and it shows `Pending` status, which quickly turns into `Failed` status. Make sure that the administrator of the account assigns you the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

## Servers are all in Unknown status
{: #troubleshooting-servers-unknown-status}

Most likely you do not have adequate permissions to view the server status. Make sure that you have the correct [permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources#managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources).

The Unknown status also might be caused by an expired IMS token. Run `bx sl init` again and rebuild the `ims_subject` with the new token. Make sure that you are passing in the `X-Subject-Token:$ims_subject` parameter in the request header.

## Error: 409 Conflict when you create an instance action
{: #troubleshooting-conflict-create-instance}

You can't create certain instance actions if the status of your instance is in conflict with another action. For example, if your instance status is `stopped`, and you try to create a `reboot` action, the system returns a 409 error.

| Status      | Action     | Conflict |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Running     | start      | yes      |
| Stopped     | Any action other than start  | yes      |
| Not running | pause      | yes      |
| Not running | reboot     | yes      |
| Not paused  | resume     | yes      |
| Paused      | Any action other than resume | yes      |

## Instance not responding to `instance-reboot` request
{: #troubleshooting-instance-not-responding}

If your instance is not responding to an `instance-reboot` request, you can try an `instance-reset` request. The `instance-reboot` request sends an OS-reboot request to the instance, while an `instance-reset` request performs a hard reset of the virtual server instance. You can think of the difference as typing "ctrl-alt-delete" on your computer's keyboard versus pressing the reset or power button. Remember that the `instance-reset` request takes longer to complete than the `instance-reboot` request.

## Why can't I add my SSH key?
{: #troubleshooting-cant-add-ssh-key}

If you try to add an SSH key to your account and get an error that the key can't be parsed, ensure there are no line breaks in the string. An SSH key is a continuous string of characters; sometimes line breaks are introduced when the SSH key is copied from a terminal. To avoid this issue, first paste your SSH key into a text editor and remove any line breaks. Then, copy the SSH key from the text editor and paste it into the VPC UI, CLI, or API.


## How do I reregister an RHEL virtual server instance?
{: #troubleshooting-reregister-RHEL-VSI}

If you see this error message:
```sh
This system is not registered with an entitlement server.
```
{: pre}

Your REHL virtual server instance was unregistered from the capsule server. To resolve this issue, run the `reregister-ng-rhel-vsi.sh` script to reregister the virtual server instance.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

## Can I configure nested virtualization on a virtual server instance?
{: #troubleshoot-enable-nested-virtualization}

Nested virtualization on virtual server instances is not a supported configuration.


## How do I resolve an SSH key error?
{: #troubleshooting-ssh-keys-errors}

When you copy an SSH key from a terminal to add the key to your VPC, sometimes extra line breaks are introduced which cause a parsing error. To avoid this issue, first paste your SSH key into a text editor and remove any extra line breaks. Then, copy the SSH key from text editor and paste it into the VPC UI, CLI, or API.

## Why do I receive an SSH key permission denied error?
{: #troubleshooting-ssh-key-permission-denied-error}

When you receive an SSH key permission denied error, your host might not be recognized as an authorized host. To add your host as a known host, run the following command in your terminal. Make sure that you replace `[sFTP]` with your host.

```sh
ssh-keyscan -t rsa [sFTP] >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
{: pre}

If you need more help, you can open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar).

## Why am I getting an error when I attempt to add more than 5 network interfaces for an existing virtual server instance?
{: #error-above-5-network-interfaces}
{: troubleshoot}

If the [x86 instance profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) that you used to provision your virtual server includes 17 or more vCPUs, you can now add more than 5 network interfaces. To take advantage of the ability to add more network interfaces to a virtual server that existed before the network interface limit increased, you must first stop a running virtual server and then start it again. For more information about multiple network interfaces, see [Managing network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-instance-vnics).

## How can I use Linux SysRq key to troubleshoot a Linux virtual server instance from the serial console?
{: #linux-vsi-serial-console}
{: troubleshoot}

An unresponsive Linux virtual server instance can occur for various reasons, such as system crashes, deadlock situations, or kernel-related issues. When the virtual server is unresponsive, standard troubleshooting methods (such as SSH or direct access) might not work. In these cases, the serial console remains accessible, which enables administrators to interact with the server at a smaller level by using the Linux System Request (SysRq) key.
{: tsSymptoms}

System failures, kernel panics, or unresponsive processes can cause a Linux server to become unavailable through regular processes. These issues might arise from software bugs, hardware faults, or misconfigured system parameters. The SysRq key provides low-level access to the Linux kernel and bypasses higher-level processes that are frozen or unresponsive. This mechanism is built into the Linux kernel as a failsafe to help users perform critical system actions, such as rebooting the server or dumping diagnostic information, even when other input methods are unavailable. It offers a direct method to control the server and obtain system-level insights when regular access methods fail.
{: tsCauses}

To troubleshoot and resolve the issue by using the SysRq key from the serial console, follow these steps:
{: tsResolve}

1. Access the virtual server instance by connecting to a serial console. For more information, see [Accessing virtual server instances by using VNC or serial consoles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_console&interface=ui).
1. Enable SysRq commands. If the SysRq commands are already enabled, you can skip this step. To enable the SysRq commands, set the kernel.sysrq parameter.

   ```sh
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Send a SysRq command from the serial console. The following example starts a kernel crash dump (kdump).
  
   1. Press the **Enter** key.
   1. Press `~B` (tilde key followed by uppercase B key).
   1. Press `c` (lowercase c) starts a kernel crash dump (kdump).

   Example:

   ```screen
   ENTER + ~ + B + c
   ```
   {: pre}

   To trigger a crash dump, make sure that the `crashkernel` is configured on the Linux virtual server instance. For instructions, see the [Kernel crash dump mechanism](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/kernel-crash-dump/).

1. Analyze diagnostic output. For example, the previous SysRq kernel crash dump generates crucial diagnostic data that you can analyze. By sending relevant SysRq commands, you can collect valuable diagnostic data for troubleshooting and regaining control of the system.

For a list of SYSRQ command keys, press **Enter** followed by `~Bh` (tilde, uppercase B, lowercase h). For more details about these keys, see [Linux Magic System Request Key Hacks - What are the âcommandâ keys?](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysrq.html){: external}
