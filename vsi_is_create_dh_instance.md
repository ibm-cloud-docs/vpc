# Creating instances on dedicated hosts
{: #creating-instance-on-dh}

After you created a dedicated host in your {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can provision virtual server instances on the dedicated host by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, the CLI, or the API.
{: shortdesc}

## Creating instances on dedicated hosts by using the console
{: #creating-dedicated-instance}
{: ui}

After you created a dedicated host, you can start provisioning virtual server instances on the dedicated host by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

The profile family and class must match for the dedicated host or dedicated group and instances that are provisioned on them. For more information, see [Dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).
{: important}

To create an instance on a dedicated host:
1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Dedicated hosts**.
2. If you want to create an instance on a specific dedicated host, on the **Dedicated hosts** tab click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the host where you want the instance to be created and select **New instance**.
3. If you want to create an instance on any dedicated host within a dedicated group, on the **Dedicated groups** tab click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the dedicated group where you want the instance to be created and select **New instance**. The virtual server instance is provisioned on any dedicated host in the group that has space available.
4. For more information, see [Creating virtual server instances by using the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers).

## Creating instances on dedicated hosts by using the CLI
{: #creating-dedicated-instance-cli}
{: cli}

After you created a dedicated host, you can start provisioning virtual server instances on the dedicated host by using the command-line interface (CLI).

### Before you begin
{: #before-you-create-dh-instance-cli}

1. Make sure that you downloaded, installed, and initialized the following CLI plug-ins. For more information, see [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
* IBM Cloud CLI
* The infrastructure-service plug-in

2. Have an [{{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-vpc-resources-with-cli-and-api&interface=cli).

### Gathering information to create an instance on a dedicated host by using the CLI
{: #gather-info-dedicated-host-vsi-cli}

Ready to create an instance on a dedicated host or dedicated group? Before you can run the `ibmcloud is instances` command, you need to know the details about the instance, such as what profile or image you want to use. You also need to know the ID of the dedicated host or the dedicated group where you want to create the virtual server instance.

Gather the following information:

|    Instance details   |  Listing options                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------|
| Image                 | `ibmcloud is images`            |
| Profile               | `ibmcloud is instance-profiles` |
| Key                   | `ibmcloud is keys`              |
| VPC                   | `ibmcloud is vpcs`              |
| Subnet                | `ibmcloud is subnets`           |
| Zone                  | `ibmcloud is zones`             |
| Dedicated host        | `ibmcloud is dedicated-hosts`   |
| Dedicated group       | `ibmcloud is dedicated-host-groups`|
{: caption="Required instance details" caption-side="bottom"}

The profile family and class must match for the dedicated host and instances that are provisioned on the host. For more information, see [Dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).

For more information, see [Gathering information to create an instance by using the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=cli#gather-info-to-create-virtual-servers-cli).

### Creating an instance on a dedicated host by using the CLI
{: #create-dedicated-host-vsi-cli}

To create an instance on a dedicated group by using the CLI, use the **ibmcloud is instance-create** command. Specify the name that you want to give the instance, the VPC, the zone, the profile that you want to use for the instance, the subnet, the image ID, and the dedicated group where you want to provision the instance. The instance is provisioned on an available dedicated host within the dedicated group.

The following example command creates a dedicated host with the following parameters:
* Name: `my-instance-name`
* VPC: `r006-e49dbfc6-03b5-4609-b680-684311be5457`
* Zone: `us-south-1`
* Profile: `mx2-2x16`
* Subnet: `0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999`
* Image: `r006-72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb8`
* Key ID: `r006-c23faac2-5983-428c-91b8-2959620e1b96`
* Dedicated group `0076-edf611ff-0fd6-44bf-b5f3-102eeb3cf928`

```sh
ibmcloud is instance-create my-instance-name r006-e49dbfc6-03b5-4609-b680-684311be5457 us-south-1 mx2-2x16 0076-2249dabc-8c71-4a54-bxy7-953701ca3999 --image-id r006-72b27b5c-f4b0-48bb-b954-5becc7c1dcb8 --keys r006-c23faac2-5983-428c-91b8-2959620e1b96 --dedicated-host-group 0076-edf611ff-0fd6-44bf-b5f3-102eeb3cf928
```

For a full list of command options, see [ibmcloud is instance-create](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#instance-create).


## Creating instances on dedicated hosts by using the API
{: #creating-dedicated-instance-api}
{: api}

The following request example creates an instance on a dedicated host with a dedicated group specified as the placement target. You can specify your dedicated group (or dedicated host) as the `placement_target`. When you specify a dedicated group for the `placement_target`, the instance is provisioned to an available dedicated host within the group.

The profile family and class must match for the dedicated host or dedicated group and instances that are provisioned on them. For more information, see [Dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).
