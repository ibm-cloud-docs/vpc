# VPC API change log
{: #api-change-log}

Read the VPC API change log to learn about updates and improvements to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) [API](/apidocs/vpc). The change log lists changes that are ordered by the date they were released. Changes to existing API versions are designed to be compatible with existing client applications.
{: shortdesc}

By design, new features with backward-incompatible changes apply only to version dates on and after the feature's release. Changes that apply to older versions of the API are designed to maintain compatibility with existing applications and code. If backward-incompatible changes require non-trivial client code changes to use an API version, the API change log might provide links to instructions, tips, or best practices for updating client code.
{: note}

Some changes, such as new response properties or new optional request parameters, are considered backward compatible. Other changes, such as new required request parameters, are not considered backward compatible. To avoid disruption from changes to the API, use the following best practices when you call the API:

- Catch and log any `4xx` or `5xx` HTTP status code, along with the included `trace` property
- Follow HTTP redirect rules for any `3xx` HTTP status code
- Consume only the resources and properties your application needs to function
- Avoid depending on behavior that is not explicitly documented

SDK changes are based on API changes. For information about the latest changes to the VPC SDKs, see the change logs in the SDK repositories:

- [Java SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-java-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Node SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-node-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Python SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-python-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Upcoming changes
{: #upcoming-changes}

### For all version dates
{: #upcoming-changes-all-version-dates}

**`Instance` response schema change.** In an upcoming release, volume attachments returned in the `boot_volume_attachment` and `volume_attachments[]` properties of an instance will not include the `volume` sub-property if the volume has not yet been provisioned. Such volumes are currently represented with empty `crn`, `id`, and `href` properties along with an undocumented sentinel value for `name`.

To prepare for this change, verify that your client checks that the `volume` property exists for a volume attachment before attempting to access its `crn`, `id`, `href`, or `name` sub-properties.

**Asynchronous `DELETE` response code change.** In an upcoming release, the response code output for asynchronous `DELETE` operations will change from `204` to `202`. A response code of `204` implies the action is completed, which could be misleading for operations that are still processing. A response code of `202` is more appropriate. This behavior change will occur only for an API version date after its release. A response code of `204` will continue to be returned for API versions up to this version date.

The new response code will be rolled out gradually. Each phase of the rollout will be tied to a dated API version. These changes will be announced in future change log updates.
{: note}

**Security group targets.** In an upcoming release, new resource types will be permitted as security group targets. If you add resources of these new types to a security group, existing client applications will be exposed to the new types when iterating over the security group's targets. To avoid disruption, check that client applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected resource types in a security group's targets.

 **Updating subnets for application load balancers.** You can now update the subnets attached to an application load balancer by specifying `subnets` when [updating a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-load-balancer). If the update requires moving your load balancer to a different zone, its `provisioning_status` will change to `migrate_pending` until the move is complete. For more information, see [Updating subnets for Application Load Balancers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=alb-updating-subnets). 

 Because the `subnets` property is an array, the specified value will replace the load balancer's existing array of subnets. To guard against concurrent updates, you must provide the resource's current ETag using the `If-Match` header. For guidance on the use of ETags, see [Concurrent update protection](apidocs/vpc/vpc/latest#concurrent-update-protection).

**Resource suspension for virtual server instances.** The [list all instances](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instances) and [retrieve an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance) methods now provide `lifecycle_reasons` and `lifecycle_state` properties. A virtual server instance that violates IBM Cloudâ€™s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.ibm.com/services/us/imc/html/aup1.html){: external} will now have its `lifecycle_state` property set to `suspended`. A suspended instance is automatically powered off and you cannot update, delete, or power it on. For more information, see [Viewing instance status and lifecycle_state in the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-virtual-server-instances&interface=api#instance-status-api) and [Resource suspension](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-resource-suspension).

**Client VPN for VPC.** Client-to-site connectivity is now available. This feature allows remote devices to securely connect to a VPC using an OpenVPN (or other compatible) software client. For more information about VPN client-to-site connectivity and how it complements the existing VPN site-to-site connectivity, see [About client-to-site VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview).

* A **VPN server** allows VPN clients from the internet to connect to a VPC. When [creating a VPN server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpn-server), you can specify a security group to protect the VPN server, and subnets in your VPC in which the VPN server will allocate its [reserved IP addresses](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-subnet-reserved-ips). For more information, see [Creating a VPN server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-server) and the new [VPN server methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-servers).
* A **VPN client** represents a client connecting from the internet. You can [retrieve the OpenVPN client configuration](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpn-server-client-configuration) to use to configure a VPN client for a VPN server. For more information, see [Setting up a client VPN environment and connecting to a VPN server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-environment-setup) and the new [VPN client methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-server-clients).
* A **VPN route** controls which subnets the VPN client can access and how the traffic from the VPN client reaches these subnets. For more information, see [Managing VPN routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-routes) and the new [VPN server route methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-server-routes).

**Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways and VPN servers.** When you [create a VPC routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table), you can now control if the routing table accepts routes from a VPN gateway or server by specifying the `accept_routes_from` property. When you [view a route in a VPC routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpc-routing-table-route), the new `origin` property shows who created the route (either `user` or `service`), and the `service` routes include a new `creator` property that references the resource that created the route. Routes with the `creator` property present cannot be deleted directly. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-site-to-site-routes-propagating) and [VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation).

**Concurrent update protection.** ETags returned on `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests represent the modifiable state of the resource. When updating the `accept_routes_from` property on a [routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table), or updating the `client_authentication`, `client_dns_servers`, or `subnets` properties on a [VPN server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpn-server), you must provide the resource's ETag using the `If-Match` header. For general guidance on the use of ETags, see [Concurrent update protection](/apidocs/vpc/latest#concurrent-update-protection).

**Block storage.** You can now create a volume from a snapshot without having to also create and attach it to a virtual server instance. When you [create a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume), a new `source_snapshot` property lets you specify a snapshot which will be used as source data for the new volume. The volume's data is fully restored later, when you attach it to an instance. Volume performance is initially degraded until the volume data is fully restored. For more information, see [Restoring an unattached data volume from a snapshot with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore&interface=api#snapshots-vpc-restore-unattached-api).

**Cross-zone member support for network load balancers.** You can now [create a load balancer pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool) with members across any zone in the region. You can also use the [create pool member](apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool-member) and [replace pool member](apidocs/vpc/latest#replace-load-balancer-pool-members) methods to update an existing pool with members across any zone in the region. The zone of the network load balancer is still identified by the subnet that you specify when you create a load balancer.

Network load balancers with `route_mode` enabled do not support cross zone members.

**Backup for VPC.** You can now create backup policies to schedule automatic backups of your block storage volumes. Backups are made when a user tag in a block storage volume matches a user tag defined in a backup policy. Backups are created by a schedule defined in a [backup plan](/apidocs/vpc-beta#create-backup-policy-plan). Each plan also has a deletion policy for managing backups created by the plan, which you can customize by specifying the `deletion_trigger` sub-property. At the scheduled interval, a backup snapshot is created of that volume. You can have up to four backup plans per policy. See [Backup for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about).

The backup policy jobs API remains in [beta](/apidocs/vpc-beta#24-may-2022).

The `2022-03-29` release includes incompatible changes. To avoid regressions in client functionality, be sure to read and follow the [`2022-03-29` API migration guide](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2022-03-29-migration) before specifying version `2022-03-29` or later in any API requests.
{: important}

### For version `2022-03-29` or later
{: #version-2022-03-29}

**Reserved IPs for compute.** You can now fully control the IP addresses assigned to your network interfaces by specifying a new or existing reserved IP when you [create an instance](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance) or [create a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc#create-bare-metal-server).

**Migration of network interface IP addresses.** In support of reserved IPs, as of version `2022-03-29`, the network interface `primary_ipv4_address` string property has been migrated to the `primary_ip` object property. See [Migrating use of IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2022-03-29-migration#migrate-ip-addresses) for guidance on how to migrate to `primary_ip`.

**Removal of security group network interfaces.** The methods for associating security groups with network interfaces that were deprecated in [API version `2021-02-23`](docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#23-february-2021) have been removed as of version `2022-03-29`. See [Migrating use of security group associations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2022-03-29-migration#migrate-security-group-assoc) for guidance on how to migrate to use security group targets, which allow security groups to be associated with VPC resources beyond network interfaces, such as endpoint gateways and load balancers.

### For all version dates
{: #29-march-2022-all-version-dates}

**Reserved IP management.** You can explicitly [Reserve an IP in a subnet](/apidocs/vpc#create-subnet-reserved-ip) ahead of time, and [List all reserved IPs on a subnet](/apidocs/vpc#list-subnet-reserved-ips) to see all your VPC resources that are using IP addresses on that subnet, including load balancers and VPN gateways (with [limitations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#ip-known-issues)). For more information, see [Managing IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-ip-addresses).

**UDP support for network load balancers.** When [creating a network load balancer](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer) (NLB), you can now set User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the communications protocol for NLB listeners and pools by specifying `udp` for the `protocol` sub-property of the [`listener`](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer-listener-request) and [`pool`](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer-pool) properties respectively. (Health checks do not support UDP for monitoring the health of pool members.) For more information, see [Configuring UDP for network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-udp&interface=api).

You must set the same protocol for the load balancer pool and listeners using that pool.
{: tip}

Not all network load balancer offerings will support UDP. Before creating a UDP network load balancer (or updating an existing NLB listener to use UDP), check that the `udp_supported` property of the [load balancer profile](/apidocs/vpc#list-load-balancer-profiles) is `true`.

**Concurrent update protection.** To prevent multiple clients from unknowingly overwriting each other's updates, select API methods support entity-tags and conditional requests. For details, see [Concurrent update protection](/apidocs/vpc#concurrent-update-protection) in the Virtual Private Cloud API.

**Instance availability policies for compute host failures.** A new `availability_policy` property has been added to the [create](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance) and [update](/apidocs/vpc#update-instances) instance methods to control the behavior when the instance's underlying compute host experiences a failure. The `host_failure` sub-property can be used to set the host failure `availability_policy` of the virtual server instance. The default policy is `restart`, which relocates the instance to a healthy host and restarts the instance. The policy may be set to `stop` to have the instance remain stopped if the compute host experiences a failure.

For more information, see [Host failure recovery policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-host-failure-recovery-policies&interface=api).

**Resizable boot volumes.** You can now increase the capacity of a boot volume, up to 250 gigabytes (GB). When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance) from an image or an [instance template](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance-template), you can specify a larger capacity than the image's `minimum_provisioned_size` default. Specify `capacity` in the `volume` sub-property of the `boot_volume_attachment` property.  You can also increase the size of an existing boot volume by specifying the `capacity` property when [updating the volume](/apidocs/vpc#update-volume).

**Port ranges for public network load balancers.** When [creating a public network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer&interface=api) you can now specify a range of listener ports. When you configure a load balancer with a port range, the `port` property of the load balancer's [pool members](/apidocs/vpc#list-load-balancer-pool-members) will not be used for port translation on incoming traffic. Instead, traffic will arrive at the member on the same port it arrived on at the listener.

Before using this feature on a load balancer, update client applications that integrate with it to check the `port_min` and `port_max` properties on the [load balancer listener](/apidocs/vpc#get-load-balancer-listener). If those properties do not have the same value, the client must consider the inclusive range between `port_min` and `port_max` as the possible ports on which traffic can arrive at the member. However, if `port_min` and `port_max` have the same value, the behavior will be unchanged and traffic will arrive on the port specified by the `port` property of the load balancer pool member.

**Bare metal servers for VPC.** You can now create bare metal servers to host VMware&reg; clusters
in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}. You can set up VMware management applications and create VMware
virtual machines on the bare metal servers. The new [bare metal
server](/vpc#list-bare-metal-servers) APIs use a similar structure and employ the same concepts as
the existing [instance](/apidocs/vpc?code=go#list-instances) APIs. There is also a parallel but
separate set of [bare metal server profile](/apidocs/vpc#list-bare-metal-server-profiles) APIs with
similar conventions to the existing [instance profile](/apidocs/vpc-scoped#list-instance-profiles)
APIs. After you've learned one concept, it will apply to the other. However, be aware that there are
some [limitations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#bare-metal-servers-limitations).

For more information, see [About Bare Metal Servers for
VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-bare-metal-servers) and [Bare metal server
profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bare-metal-servers-profile&interface=api), or dive into the new [API
methods](/apidocs/vpc#list-bare-metal-server-profiles).

**Security groups for endpoint gateways.** For enhanced security, you can now associate security
groups with [endpoint gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe). When you [create an endpoint
gateway](/apidocs/vpc#create-endpoint-gateway), you can now specify the `security_groups`
property, which associates those security groups with the endpoint gateway. If you do not specify
`security_groups`, the endpoint gateway will be associated with the VPC's default security group.
Before using the default security group, review your default security group rules and, if necessary,
edit the rules to accommodate your endpoint gateway traffic.

Responses that return an endpoint gateway now include the `security_groups` property. On endpoint
gateways created before 25 January 2022, the `security_groups` property in the response is an empty
array (`[]`), and no security groups are set.

You can update security groups for an endpoint gateway by [adding an endpoint
gateway](/apidocs/vpc#create-security-group-target-binding) to or [removing an endpoint
gateway](/apidocs/vpc#delete-security-group-target-binding) from a security group's targets.

You will not be able to remove the only remaining security group from an endpoint gateway. As a
result, if you add a security group to an endpoint gateway which had no security groups, you will
not be able to revert the endpoint gateway to have no security groups.

Finally, the security group `targets` property can now refer to an endpoint gateway, as can the
responses for the [get security group target](/apidocs/vpc#get-security-group-target) and
[list security group target](/apidocs/vpc#list-security-group-targets) methods.

**Snapshots for VPC.** A `captured_at` property has been added to each
[snapshot](/apidocs/vpc#list-snapshots), indicating the date and time when the snapshot was captured
from the volume. The `captured_at` timestamp value is a close approximation to the actual snapshot
time, typically within a few seconds. The actual snapshot capture is between the `created_at` and
`captured_at` timestamps. (The `created_at` property indicates when the [snapshot
creation](/apidocs/vpc#create-snapshot) process was initiated.)

If `captured_at` is absent from the response, the snapshot's data has not yet been captured.
Additionally, the property may be absent for snapshots created before 1 January 2022.

**Snapshots for VPC.** Restrictions have been removed for deleting snapshots. You can now [delete](/apidocs/vpc#delete-snapshot) any snapshot in the chain of snapshots.  If the snapshot is actively being used to restore a volume, the snapshot will remain in `deleting` until the restore completes. The `deletable` property, which indicated whether a snapshot could be deleted, has been deprecated.

**GPU instances.**Â Updated instance and instance profile methods now include details about GPUs attached to the instance. New profiles provide support for GPUs. These GPUs provide accelerated computing to help you run workloads with more powerful compute capabilities.

The [list all instances](/apidocs/vpc#list-instances) method returns a new `gpu` property with additional sub-properties: `count`, `manufacturer`, `model`, and `memory`. The [retrieve an instance profile](/apidocs/vpc#get-instance-profile) method returns new properties: `gpu_count`, `gpu_manufacturer`, `gpu_model`, and `gpu_memory`. For more information, see [Managing GPUs](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-gpus).

**Route mode for VNF support for network load balancers.** [Network load balancers](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer) now support a new "route mode" enabling virtual network functions (VNFs) as back-end targets. A `route_mode` property has been added to the load balancer resource to indicate if the load balancer is in route mode. A `route_mode_supported` property has been added to the load balancer profile resource to indicate if the profile supports route mode. Presently, only network load balancer profiles support route mode.

The [Create load balancer](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer) and [Create load balancer listener](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer-listener) methods now accept properties `port_min` and `port_max`. You can request a load balancer listener for a single port by setting either the `port` property, or by setting the `port_min` and `port_max` properties to the same value. All load balancer listener responses now include `port_min` and `port_max` properties, with `port_min` matching the value of the existing `port` property.

When creating load balancers with route mode enabled, you must specify the listener's `port_min` value as `1`,  the `port_max` value as `65535`, and omit the `port` property. Other port range values are not currently supported, as noted in [Known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues).
{: note}

**Instance bandwidth.** New properties have been added to the [create](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance) and [update](/apidocs/vpc#update-instance) instance methods to allow adjustment to the amount of total bandwidth (in megabits per second) allocated exclusively to attached volumes. The range of acceptable volume bandwidth values depends on the selected instance profile. A new `total_volume_bandwidth` property, added to each [instance profile](/apidocs/vpc#list-instance-profiles), provides the range of possible values, and the default value used when creating an instance. An increase in `total_volume_bandwidth` will result in a corresponding decrease to `total_network_bandwidth`.

The volume bandwidth allocated to your existing instances will be unaffected unless:
- The instance's `total_volume_bandwidth` is lowered
- The total bandwidth requested by the instance's attached volumes exceeds the amount already requested by its attached volumes

For more information about this feature, see [Bandwidth allocation for instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bandwidth-allocation-profiles).

**Block storage volumes:**

- **Adjustable IOPS.** To manage the performance the your data volumes attached to running virtual server instances, use the [update volume](/apidocs/vpc#update-volume) method to specify a different tiered `profile` value, or a different `iops` value within the [custom IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#custom) tier. For more information, see [Adjusting IOPS for block storage volumes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops&interface=api).

- **Expandable volumes.** You can now expand a secondary volume attached to a running virtual server instance. Use the `capacity` property in the [update volume](/apidocs/vpc#update-volume) method to request a new volume capacity, up to 16 TB (depending on the volume's profile).  While the volume's capacity is being updated, the volume will remain available for use, but will have a `status` value of `updating`. For more information, see [Expanding block storage volume capacity](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes).

   If you expand an existing data volume, be aware that existing applications will be exposed to the new `updating` value. To avoid disruption, first check that your applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected `status` values.

**Application load balancers.** Use the [HTTPS redirect feature](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers#https-redirect-listener) to redirect traffic from an HTTP load balancer listener to an HTTPS listener.

An HTTPS redirect can be configured on either [load balancer listeners](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers) or [load balancer policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-layer-7-load-balancing), or both.  An HTTPS redirect is configured on the listener using the new `https_redirect` property, and will be used if none of the listener policy's rules match (or if it has no rules). An HTTPS redirect is configured on a load balancer policy using the new policy `action` value of `https_redirect`, and will be used only when all of the policy's rules match.

If you configure an HTTPS redirect on a listener policy, be aware that existing applications will be exposed to the new `https_redirect` value. To avoid disruption, check that your applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected `action` values first.
{: important}

Additional API restrictions are enforced after an HTTPS redirect is configured:

- You will not be able to [update the `protocol` and `accept_proxy_protocol` properties](/apidocs/vpc#update-load-balancer-listener) of the HTTP and HTTPS listeners. Instead, delete the listener and create a new listener with the new property values.
- You will not be able to [delete an HTTPS listener](/apidocs/vpc#delete-load-balancer-listener) until the HTTP listener referring to it is deleted.

**Larger size boot volumes for custom images.** You can import custom images with a boot disk size from 10 GB to 250 GB, which will become the image's `minimum_provisioned_size` after import. When you specify the image as part of [creating an instance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers), the boot volume `capacity` is set to the image's `minimum_provisioned_size`. For details, see [Planning custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images).

**Placement groups.** Placement groups for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} are logical groupings of virtual server instances that can be configured to reduce the risk of correlated failures inherent in your physical environment, such as networking issues, power loss, or hardware failure. Define a placement group strategy for high-availability workloads, such as for host or power spread.

**Instance storage.** New instance profiles can now optionally include a set of solid state disks. These instance storage disks provide temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud-native workloads that need scratch space, large data caches, or data replicated across availability zones.

The following API methods have been added:

- [List all disks on an instance](/apidocs/vpc#list-instance-disks) (`GET /instances/{instance_id}/disks`)
- [Retrieve an instance disk](/apidocs/vpc#get-instance-disk) (`GET /instances/{instance_id}/disks/{id}`)
- [Update an instance disk](/apidocs/vpc#update-instance-disk) (`PATCH /instances/{instance_id}/disks/{id}`)
- [List all disks on a dedicated host](/apidocs/vpc#list-dedicated-host-disks) (`GET /dedicated_hosts/{dedicated_host_id}/disks`)
- [Retrieve a dedicated host disk](/apidocs/vpc#get-dedicated-host-disk) (`GET /dedicated_hosts/{dedicated_host_id}/disks/{id}`)
- [Update a dedicated host disk](/apidocs/vpc#update-dedicated-host-disk) (`PATCH /dedicated_hosts/{dedicated_host_id}/disks/{id}`)

API methods that return instance and dedicated host profiles now include a `disks` property with information about the storage capability (where present) of resources provisioned with those profiles.

API methods that return instances and dedicated hosts now include a `disks` property with information about the disks configured for those resources.

For more information, see [About instance storage](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage).

**Virtual server instance console.** You can now access your instances by connecting to a VNC or serial console. Learn about [Accessing virtual server instances by using VNC or serial consoles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_console), and explore the new instance console API methods:

- [Create a console access token for an instance](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance-console-access-token) (`POST /instances/{instance_id}/console_access_token`)
- [Retrieve the console WebSocket for an instance](/apidocs/vpc#get-instance-console) (`GET /instances/{instance_id}/console`)

**Instance resize.** You can now resize an instance by providing the `profile` property in the API method `PATCH /instances/{id}` ([Update an instance](/apidocs/vpc#update-instance)).

**New parameter-based rule types for an application load balancer.** When creating a load balancer listener policy rule, the `field` property may now be set to `query` or `body` to perform additional forms of layer 7 load balancing:

- `query` - Write layer 7 rules that use the query string to route traffic to a specific target. For a `query` type rule, `field` and `value` must be percent-encoded, same as the query string in the URL.
- `body` - If the body of the `POST` request uses form encoding (UTF-8), then you can create layer 7 rules to route traffic based on the parameter name and value in the body. The `Content-Type` in the request is ignored.

If you use these new rule types, be aware that existing client applications will be exposed to those new values in the existing  properties. To avoid disruption, check that client applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected values for these properties before using these new rule types for an application load balancer.

**Bring your own license.** You can now [bring your own license](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-byol-vpc-about) (BYOL) for custom images that you create and import to IBM Cloud VPC. When you import a custom image, you can choose from new `byol` Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Windows operating systems.

A new `dedicated_host_only` property has been added to operating system resources. Any instance with a boot volume created from an image with `operating_system.dedicated_host_only` set to `true` must be placed on a dedicated host (or into a dedicated host group). Because Windows BYOL images have `dedicated_host_only` set to `true`, they must be placed on a dedicated host (or into a dedicated host group). There are no restrictions on placing instances using RHEL BYOL images.

Every operation that returns an `OperatingSystem` resource now includes a `dedicated_host_only` property.

**Additional VPN for VPC IKEv2 encryption/hash/Diffie Hellman (DH) group support.** For enhanced security, VPN for VPC now supports SHA2-512 (a Secure Hash Algorithm) and DH group 19 (a 256-bit elliptic curve algorithm) to generate a symmetric key.

If you use these new algorithms, be aware that existing client applications will be exposed to those new values in the existing `authentication_algorithm` and `dh_group` properties. To avoid disruption, check that client applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected values for these properties before using these new algorithms.
{: important}

The following VPN for VPC methods have been updated:

- In IKE policies, the `authentication_algorithm` property now includes a `sha512` value, and the `dh_group` property includes a `19` value.
- In IPsec policies, the `authentication_algorithm` property now includes a `sha512` value, and the `pfs` property includes a `group_19` value.

**New VPN gateway property.** Each element of the existing VPN gateway `members` array now includes a `private_ip` property, which provides the IP address assigned to that VPN gateway member.

**Application load balancer security group integration.** For enhanced security, application load balancers can now be associated with security groups. You can specify one or more security groups when you create the application load balancer, and associate security groups with your existing application load balancers. If you omit security groups during load balancer creation, the default security group for the VPC is used.

If you plan to use default security groups for new application load balancers, review your default security group rules. If necessary, edit the rules to accommodate your expected application load balancer traffic.
{: tip}

The following load balancer methods have been updated:

- [Create a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer) (`POST /load_balancers`) can now accept a list of security groups
- [Get load balancer details](/apidocs/vpc#get-load-balancer) (`GET /load_balancers/{id}`) now returns references to the security groups to which a load balancer is attached

New security group methods have been added for managing security group targets:

- [Attach a security group to a target network interface or load balancer](/apidocs/vpc#create-security-group-target-binding) (`PUT /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)
- [List targets attached to a security group](/apidocs/vpc#list-security-group-targets) (`GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets`)
- [Retrieve a target in a security group](/apidocs/vpc#get-security-group-target) (`GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)
- [Delete targets from a security group](/apidocs/vpc#delete-security-group-target-binding) (`DELETE /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)

Use the security group target methods to manage security group attachments to both load balancers and network interfaces. The original methods specific to network interfaces are now deprecated:

- `GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces`
- `DELETE /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`
- `GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`
- `PUT /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`

For more information, see [Integrating an IBM Cloud Application Load Balancer for VPC with security groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-alb-integration-with-security-groups).

**Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) support for VPC.** VPC address prefixes are no longer restricted to [RFC-1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) addresses. You must now configure VPCs that use both non-RFC-1918 addresses and have public connectivity (floating IPs or public gateways) using a custom route that contains the new `delegate_vpc` property. You must specify this property for destination CIDRs that are non-RFC-1918 compliant and outside of the VPC, such as for destinations that are reachable through {{site.data.keyword.dl_full}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway, or VPC classic access.

The `delegate_vpc` property is not required if a VPC uses only RFC-1918 addresses or has no public connectivity.
{: note}

The following API methods have been updated:

- View theÂ `delegate_vpc` property in the requests and responses for `/vpcs/{vpc_id}/routing_tables/{routing_table_id}/routes`.
- View reserved IP ranges in `POST /vpcs/{vpc_id}/address_prefixes`, which creates an address pool prefix.

**Customer-managed encryption for block storage volumes and encrypted custom images.** When you disable or delete a customer root key (CRK) that is encrypting your block storage or custom image resources, the API displays a status of `unusable` for these resources, along with the reason codes `encryption_key_deleted` or `encryption_key_disabled`.

The `unusable` status appears in the following API methods:

- [List all volumes](/apidocs/vpc#list-volumes) (`GET /volumes`)
- [Retrieve a specific volume](/apidocs/vpc#get-volume) (`GET /volumes/{id}`)
- [List all images](/apidocs/vpc#list-volumes) (`GET /images`)

**Support for ingress routing** is included as part of [routing tables](/apidocs/vpc#list-vpc-routing-tables), which were released on 30 October 2020. Use [ingress routing](/apidocs/vpc#create-vpc-routing-table) to control the policy for packets that are coming in to your VPC or one of its zones. The policy can vary, depending on the type of source and the destination IP address range.

Routing tables for the VPC API are the same for both egress and ingress routing, with the following additional properties that you can specify for ingress routing:

- `route_direct_link_ingress`
- `route_transit_gateway_ingress`
- `route_transit_gateway_ingress`

Explore new API methods for [routing tables](/apidocs/vpc#list-vpc-routing-tables) and [routes](/apidocs/vpc#create-vpc-routing-table-route). This feature subsumes the [VPC routing API](/apidocs/vpc#list-all-routes-in-the-vpc-s-default-routing-table), which remains supported but is deprecated and might be removed in a future API release.

- **Virtual private endpoint gateways.** Use [virtual private endpoint gateways](/apidocs/vpc#list-endpoint-gateways) to connect to supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choice, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC. For more information, see [About virtual private endpoint gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe).

- **VPC network interfaces.** IP anti-spoofing checks had already been provided for enhanced security. However, certain use cases, such as having a virtual server instance act as a network gateway, require selective disabling of these checks. To accommodate these use cases, if you have the `is.instance.instance.ip-spoofing` IAM action, you can now enable the `allow_ip_spoofing` property when you [create a network interface](/apidocs/vpc#create-instance-network-interface). Alternatively, toggle the property when you [update an existing network interface](/apidocs/vpc#update-instance-network-interface). See also [About IP spoofing checks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ip-spoofing-about).

- **Proxy protocol for application load balancers for VPC.** When you configure a load balancer [pool](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer-pool) to use proxy protocol, the pool will pass information about the client to a back-end pool member when a connection is opened.

    You can also configure a load balancer [listener](/apidocs/vpc#create-load-balancer-listener) to accept proxy protocol information. This feature is useful when the client is, itself, a proxy (which, in turn, was connected to by the actual client) that supports the proxy protocol. This allows client information to be obtained and passed on to any pools that, themselves, have the proxy protocol enabled.
