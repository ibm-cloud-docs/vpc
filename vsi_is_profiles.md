# Profiles
{: #profiles}

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}}, you can select from three families of profiles: Balanced, Compute, and  Memory.

A profile is a combination of instance attributes, such as the number of vCPUs, amount of RAM, and more that can be instantiated quickly to start a virtual server instance. In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, you can choose from popular profile configurations or select from a list of profiles that best fit your needs.
{: shortdesc}

The following profile families are available:

| Families | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Balanced](#balanced) | Best for midsize databases and common cloud applications with moderate traffic. |
| [Compute](#compute)  | Best for moderate to high web traffic workloads. Compute profiles are best for workloads with intensive CPU demands, such as high web traffic workloads, production batch processing, and front-end web servers. |
| [Memory](#memory) | Best for memory caching and real-time analytics workloads. Memory profiles are best for memory intensive workloads, such as large caching workloads, intensive database applications, or in-memory analytics workloads. |
<!-- | GPU | Best for artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning workloads. Available for POWER processing architecture only. (deprecated) | -->
{: caption="Table 1. Virtual server family selections" caption-side="top"}

## Balanced
{: #balanced}

The balanced profiles provide a good mix of performance and scalability for more common workloads.

The following balanced profiles are available for x86_64 processors:

| Profile | vCPU | GB RAM | Network Performance Cap (Gbps) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| bx2-2x8 | 2 | 8 | 4 |
| bx2-4x16 | 4 | 16 | 8 |
| bx2-8x32 | 8 | 32 | 16 |
| bx2-16x64 | 16 | 64 | 32 |
| bx2-32x128 | 32  | 128 | 64 |
| bx2-48x192 | 48 | 192 | 80 |
{: caption="Table 2. x86-64 balanced profile options" caption-side="top"}

## Compute
{: #compute}

Compute profiles are best for workloads with intensive CPU demands, such as high web traffic workloads, production batch processing, and
front-end web servers.

The following compute profiles are available for x86_64 processors:

| Profile | vCPU | GB RAM | Network Performance Cap (Gbps) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| cx2-2x4 | 2 | 4 | 4 |
| cx2-4x8 | 4 | 8 | 8 |
| cx2-8x16 | 8 | 16 | 16 |
| cx2-16x32 | 16 | 32 | 32 |
| cx2-32x64 | 32  | 64 | 64 |
| cx2-48x96 | 48  | 96 | 80 |
{: caption="Table 3. x86-64 compute profile options" caption-side="top"}

## Memory
{: #memory}

Memory profiles are best for memory intensive workloads, such as large caching workloads, intensive database applications, or in-memory
analytics workloads.

The following memory profiles are available for x86_64 processors:

| Profile | vCPU | GB RAM | Network Performance Cap (Gbps) |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| mx2-2x16 | 2 | 16 | 4 |
| mx2-4x32 | 4 | 32 | 8 |
| mx2-8x64 | 8 | 64 | 16 |
| mx2-16x128 | 16 | 128 | 32 |

| mx2-48x384 | 48 | 384 | 80 |
{: caption="Table 4. x86-64 memory profile options" caption-side="top"}

<!-- ## GPU (deprecated with POWER-based instances)
{: #gpu}

GPU profiles are best for AI and deep learning workloads.

The following GPU profiles, available for POWER-based instances, are provisioned with Ubuntu 18.04. The profiles feature NVLink 2.0 and PCIe Gen4 interconnects for faster CPU to GPU bandwidth and 50% faster networking I/O. Each GPU is a NVIDIA Tesla v100 and each includes 32 GBs of memory that contributes to the overall memory the virutal server instance reports.

** (GMW 10/20/20 - pulled out the table coding after the table header as it was causing a chkpii problem with the comment coding) 

| Profile | vCPU | GB RAM | Network Performance Cap (Gbps) | Number of GPUs |
| gp2-24x224x2 | 24 |224 | 72 | 2 |
| gp2-32x256x4 | 32 | 256 | 96 | 4 |
| gp2-56x448x4 | 56 | 448 | 100 | 4 |
| gp2-56x896x4 | 56 | 896 | 100 | 4 |
{: caption="Table 5. Power GPU profile options" caption-side="top"}

GPU profiles are supported by Ubuntu 18.04 only. For more information about supported operating systems, see [Images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images). A few of the larger profile sizes might require you to increase your quota limit. To increase a quota for a particular resource, [contact support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-getting-customer-support).

If you are using GPU profiles, you might need to install the NVIDA kernel driver, the CUDA toolkit, or both onto your virtual server instance. For more information, see [Setting up GPU drivers for POWER-based instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-setup-gpus).
{:tip} -->

For information about storage, see [Storage notes for profiles](#storage-notes-for-profiles). 

The network bandwidth cap applies separately to egress (transmitted) and ingress (received) traffic. That is, even if an instance capped at 4 Gbps has reached its transmit cap of 4 Gbps, that will not impact its ability to receive up to its cap of 4 Gbps. For information about network performance, see [Network performance notes for profiles](#network-perf-notes-for-profiles).

## Viewing profile configurations
{: #popular-profiles}

You can view available profile configurations by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the CLI. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, you can select from popular profile configurations that support most common use cases.

### Understanding the naming rule of the profiles
{: #profiles-naming-rule}

The following information describes the naming rule of the profiles.

The first character represents the profile families. Different profile families have different ratios of CPU to memory, which is designed for different workloads.
-	"b": balanced family, 1:4 ratio
-	"c": compute family (higher on the CPUs), 1:2 ratio
-	"m": memory family (higher on the memory), 1:8 ratio

The second character represents the CPU architecture.
- "x": x86_64

The third character represents the generation of VPC the profile is for.
-	"1": IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for Classic
-	"2": IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC

The field after "-" represents the number of vCPU and the size of RAM (GB), e.g., "2x8" means this profile has 2 vCPU and a RAM of 8 GB.

Take “bx2-4x16” as an example, you can know from the name that it is a balanced profile with a 1:4 CPU to memory ratio (4 vCPU and 16 GB RAM). The CPU architecture is x86_64 and this profile is for VPC.

### Using the IBM Cloud console
{: #profiles-using-console}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, navigate to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Virtual server instances**.
2. From the Virtual server instances page, click **New instance**.
3. You can either select a profile configuration from **Popular profiles** or click **All profiles** to view more configurations.

### Using the CLI
{: #profiles-using-cli}

To view the list of available profiles using the CLI, run the following command:
```
$ ibmcloud is instance-profiles
```
{:codeblock}

## Storage notes for profiles
{: #storage-notes-for-profiles}

When you create secondary data volumes, you select a volume profile that best meets your requirements. Volume profiles are available
as three predefined [IOPS tiers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) or as a [custom IOPS profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#custom). These volume profiles relate to virtual server instance profiles:

* A [3 IOPS general-purpose tier profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) provides IOPS/GB performance suitable for a virtual server instance Balanced profile.
* A [5-IOPS tier](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) profile provides IOPS/GB performance suitable for a virtual server instance Compute profile.
* A [10-IOPS tier](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) profile provides IOPS/GB performance suitable for a virtual server instance Memory profile.

## Network performance notes for profiles
{: #network-perf-notes-for-profiles}

Every profile has a maximum network bandwidth of 2 Gbps per vCPU, with a cap of 80 Gbps. Network bandwidth is distributed evenly across network interfaces, and each network interface has a cap of 16 Gbps that might limit the overall performance. You might need to attach multiple network interfaces to your virtual server instance to optimize network performance.

For example, if you choose a profile with 16 vCPU, the network cap for the profile is 32 Gbps. If you have just one network interface, the maximum network performance is 16 Gbps due to the network interface cap. You  need to attach two network interfaces (16 Gbps each) to reach the profile cap of 32 Gbps.

After you choose a profile, it's time to create an instance.
