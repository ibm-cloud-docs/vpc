# Managing backup policies
{: #backup-service-manage}

You can manage backup policies and their associated plans that were created for your resources in the console, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform. You can delete policies and plans that you no longer need. You can update the backup policy and plans when your needs change. You can add or remove tags. You can check the status of your backup policies. Audit your policies by integrating Activity tracking events.
{: shortdesc}

## Managing backup policies in the console
{: #backup-manage-policy-ui}
{: ui}

You can rename a backup policy, delete a plan within a backup policy, delete the policy, and edit user tags in the console.

### Renaming a backup policy in the console
{: #backup-rename-policy-ui}

You can rename a policy from the list of backup policies or from the backup policies details page.

* From the list of backup policies, click the Actions icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select **Rename**.

* From the policy details page, click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") next to the policy name.

### Editing tags for target resources in the console
{: #backup-edit-tags}

From the Backup policy details page, you can edit the tags for your target resources.

1. Go to the [details page for a backup policy](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-view-policy).

2. For **Tags for target resources**, click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit").

3. In the new window, enter a user tag name. For existing block volumes or file shares with user tags, enter the tag name exactly as it appears in the volume or share. You can also add a user tag here and then go back and add it to a volume or share. You need only one tag to create a backup.

4. Click **Next**.

5. Review the information on the next window. If you're satisfied, check the disclaimer and click **Save changes**.

### Editing consistency group members in the console
{: #backup-consistency-group-update-ui}

From the Backup policy details page, you can include or exclude {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} boot volumes in the backup policy.

1. Go to the [details page for a backup policy](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-view-policy).

2. On the Overview tab, look for **Boot volume** in the Policy details, and click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") to change the value.

### Editing a backup plan in the console
{: #backup-edit-delete-plan-ui}

After you provisioned a backup policy and created a backup plan, you can edit the plan details or delete the plan. You must have at least one remaining plan for the policy to create backups.

1. From the [backup plan details](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-view-policy) page, expand the Actions menu for the plan.

2. Select **Edit**. The plan details appear in the side panel. You can modify the same information that you specified when you created the plan, such as the name and backup frequency. For individual volume backups, you can enable or disable fast restore, or change which regions fast restore is available in. You can also enable or disable the creation and retention of copies in other regions. Fast restore and cross-region copy features are not supported for multi-volume or file share backups.

3. Confirm your selections when you're finished.

Changes in the policy plan apply to future backups. For example, if you enable the creation of copies in a remote region, then the Backup snapshots that existed before the change are not copied to the remote location. The next time that the plan triggers the creation of a backup snapshot, a copy of that snapshot is created in the remote region.

## Managing backup policies and plans from the CLI
{: #backup-manage-policy-cli}
{: cli}

Delete a backup policy, rename a policy, and edit user tags from the CLI.

### Before you begin
{: #backup-manage-policy-cli-prereq}

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
{: requirement}

Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

```sh
ibmcloud login --sso -a cloud.ibm.com
```
{: pre}

This command returns a URL and prompts for a passcode. Go to that URL in your browser and log in. If successful, you get a one-time passcode. Copy this passcode and paste it as a response on the prompt. After successful authentication, you are prompted to choose your account. If you have access to multiple accounts, select the account that you want to log in as. Respond to any remaining prompts to finish logging in.

### Renaming a backup policy from the CLI
{: #backup-rename-policy-cli}

Run the `ibmcloud is backup-policy-update` command and specify the policy ID or policy name, and a new name for the backup policy.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-update POLICY [--name NEW_NAME] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

The following example renames a backup policy that is identified by name:

```sh

### Updating a backup plan from the CLI
{: #backup-update-plan-cli}

Run the `ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update` command to update a backup plan. Identify the policy and plan by ID or name in the command line. You can update the plan name, `cron-spec` backup schedule, attach user tags, update backup retention period, add, or remove fast restore zones.

The following code snippet shows the command syntax.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update POLICY PLAN [--name NAME] [--active] [--attach-tags ATTACH_TAGS] [--copy-tags true | false] [--cron-spec CRON_SPEC] [[--delete-after DELETE_AFTER] [--delete-over-count DELETE_OVER_COUNT]] [--reset-delete-over-count] [[--clone-policy-zones  ZONE1,ZONE2,...] [--clone-policy-max-snapshots CLONE_POLICY_MAX_SNAPSHOTS]] [--remote-region-policies REMOTE_REGION_POLICY_JSON | @REMOTE_REGION_POLICY_JSON] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

To rename the backup plan, run the command like the following example. It specifies the backup policy and plan by name, and changes the name of the plan from `my-policy-plan-c` to `my-policy-plan-b`.

```sh
cloudshell:~$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update new-policy-23 my-policy-plan-c --name my-policy-plan-b

To update locations of fast restore clones of backup snapshots, run the command like the following example. It specifies the backup policy and plan by their IDs. Because only `eu-de-1` is specified in the `--clone-policy-zones` option, fast restore snapshot clones are no longer retained in `eu-de-2`. The update also changes the number of backup clones to be created and stored in that zone from three to five.

```sh
cloudshell:~$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update r138-0521986d-963c-4c18-992d-d6a7a99d115f r138-6f4f08ba-e0bb-470f-bbfb-f3a22aebbfa9  --clone-policy-max-snapshots 5 --clone-policy-zones eu-de-1

To update the backup plan to include the creation of a remote copy of the backup snapshot in a different region, run the `backup-policy-plan-update` command with `--remote-region-policies` option. The following example updates the _my-policy-plan-b_ plan that is part of the _new-policy-23_. It specifies the `us-east` region as the destination of the remote region copy. Optionally, you can add the `--encryption-key` option to provide the CRN of the root key to be used to decrypt the snapshot in the remote region.

```sh
cloudshell:~$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update new-policy-23 my-policy-plan-b --remote-region-policies '[

The next time that the policy plan triggers the creation of backups, the backup snapshot is copied to the specified remote region. Backup snapshots that existed before the change in the backup policy plan are not copied to the remote location.

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-update`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-vpc-reference#backup-policy-plan-update){: external}.

Fast restore and cross-region copy features are not supported for multi-volume or file share backups.
{: note}

## Managing backup policies and plans with the API
{: #backup-manage-policy-api}
{: api}

You can rename and update a policy, edit user tags, and delete a backup policy programmatically with the API.

### Renaming a backup policy with the API
{: #backup-rename-policy-api}

To change the name of a backup policy, make a `PATCH /backup_policies/{backup_policies_id}` request and specify a new name for a backup policy. The following example shows how to rename policy `5063bfe5-c16f-4606-ba26-fba0f099b97d` to `my-backup-policy`.

```sh
curl -X PATCH\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/5063bfe5-c16f-4606-ba26-fba0f099b97d?version=2022-06-28&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
  -d {"name": "my-backup-policy"}
```
{: codeblock}

### Editing tags for target resources with the API
{: #backup-edit-tags-api}

To update the user tags for target resources, make a `PATCH /backup_policies/{backup_policies_id}` request and specify the new tag like the following example.

```sh
curl -X PATCH\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/5063bfe5-c16f-4606-ba26-fba0f099b97d?version=2022-06-28&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
  -d {"match_user_tags": ["my-daily-backup-policy"]}
```
{: codeblock}

### Editing consistency group members with the API
{: #backup-consistency-group-update-api}

When you want to update a multi-volume backup policy to include or exclude the boot volume from the consistency group, you can make a `PATCH /backup_policies/{backup_policies_id}` request and specify the value for `included-content` property as either `data_volumes`, `boot_volume`, or just `data_volumes`.

```sh
curl -X PATCH\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/5063bfe5-c16f-4606-ba26-fba0f099b97d?version=2022-06-28&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
  -d {"included_content": ["data_volumes"]}
```
{: codeblock}

### Updating a backup plan with the API
{: #backup-update-plan-api}

Make a `PATCH /backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` request to update the backup plan by specifying the following properties:

* `attach_user_tags` specifies the user tags from the backup policy that are to be attached to backups created by the plan. Updating this value doesn't change the user tags for backups that were already created by this plan.

* `copy_user_tags` specifies whether source tags are to be copied to the backup snapshot. The value is a Boolean, it's either `true` or `false`.

* `deletion_trigger` has two properties. The `delete_after` property sets the number of days to keep a backup. The `delete_over_count` property sets the maximum number of recent backups to keep. When the maximum number is reached, the oldest backup is deleted to make space for a new one. Specify `null` to remove the existing maximum.

### Updating a backup policy plan for the fast restore option with the API
{: #baas-update-plan-fast-restore-api}

Make a `POST /backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` request to update a backup plan. Specify the `clone_policy` property and `zones` subproperty to indicate which zone in your region you want to create the backup snapshot clone. The zone must be different than your source zone. You can specify multiple zones. The plan includes keeping a maximum of two cached backup snapshots in each zone.

This example updates a backup policy to create a backup plan. The new plan defines a clone policy to create snapshot clones in zone _us-south-3_. The plan specifies keeping a maximum of three cached backup snapshots.

```json
curl -X POST "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/8758bd18-344b-486a-b606-5b8cb8cdd044/plans?version=2022-12-09&generation=2"\

### Updating a backup policy plan to include creation of a copy in another region with the API
{: #baas-update-plan-crc-api}

Make a `PATCH /backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` request to update a backup plan. Specify the `remote_region_policies` property and `region` subproperty to indicate the region where you want to create the backup copy.

This example updates a backup policy to create a backup plan that creates backups in the `us-south` region and includes the creation of a remote copy. The following example specifies that the copies are to be created in the `us-east` region.

The next time that the policy plan triggers the creation of backups, the backup snapshot is copied to the specified remote region. Backup snapshots that existed before the change in the backup policy plan are not copied to the remote location.

Fast restore and cross-region copy features are not supported for multi-volume or file share backups.
{: note}

## Managing backup policies and plans with Terraform
{: #backup-manage-policy-terraform}
{: terraform}

You can manage backup policies by using Terraform.

To use Terraform, download the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. For more information, see [Getting started with Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).
{: requirement}

VPC infrastructure services use a specific regional endpoint, which targets to `us-south` by default. If your VPC is created in another region, make sure to target the appropriate region in the provider block in the `provider.tf` file.

See the following example of targeting a region other than the default `us-south`.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-de"
}
```
{: screen}

### Updating a backup policy with Terraform
{: #backup-rename-policy-terraform}

To update a backup policy, use the `ibm_is_backup_policy` resource. The following example identifies the name of the backup policy and the associated tags.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_backup_policy" "example" {
  match_user_tags = ["dev:env","bck:test",]
  name            = "example-backup-policy"
}
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_is_backup_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_backup_policy){: external}.

### Updating a backup plan with Terraform
{: #backup-update-plan-terraform}

To update a backup policy, use the `ibm_is_backup_policy_plan` resource. The following example resource identifies the policy by ID, and you can change the plan's name or its schedule by updating the name or the cron_spec arguments.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_backup_policy_plan" "example" {
  backup_policy_id = "r138-0521986d-963c-4c18-992d-d6a7a99d115f"
  cron_spec        = "10 20 * * *"
  name             = "example-backup-policy-plan"
}
```
{: codeblock}

The following example is a resource definition that you can use to update the backup plan with fast restore clones in two eu-de zones.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_backup_policy_plan" "example" {
  backup_policy_id = "r138-0521986d-963c-4c18-992d-d6a7a99d115f"
  cron_spec        = "10 20 * * *"
  name             = "example-backup-policy-plan"
  clone_policy {
    zones          = ["eu-de-1", "eu-de-2"]
    max_snapshots  = 4
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_is_backup_policy_plan](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_backup_policy_plan){: external}.

Fast restore and cross-region copy features are not supported for multi-volume or file share backups.
{: note}

## Backup policy deletion overview
{: #backup-delete}

You can delete a plan or multiple plans within a policy. When you delete a backup policy, you also delete all the plans that are associated with it.

When you delete a backup policy, it no longer creates new backups. However, the existing backups that it created remain intact as their lifecycle is independent from the policy. Existing backups are retained until their expiration date.

### Deleting a backup plan in the console
{: #backup-delete-plan}
{: ui}

1. Go to the [list of backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-list-all-policies) and locate the backup policy.

2. On the backup policy details page, select the plan that you want to delete. Expand the Actions menu for the plan, and select **delete**. You can have up to four backup plans per policy.

### Deleting a backup policy in the console
{: #backup-delete-policy}
{: ui}

1. Go to the [list of backup policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-view-policies&interface=ui#backup-list-all-policies).

2. Locate the policy that you want to delete.

3. From the Actions menu, select **Delete**.

   Confirm that the resources that are associated with the backup policy are no longer to be backed up, and that backups that were created by the policy continue to exist. You must go to the [list of snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-manage&interface=ui#snapshots-vpc-delete-snapshot-ui) and delete each one manually.

4. Enter _delete_ to confirm, the click **Delete policy**.

### Deleting a backup plan from the CLI
{: #backup-delete-plan-cli}
{: cli}

Run the `ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-delete` command and specify the backup policy and the plan or plans that you want to delete. You can specify the backup policy and plans by ID or by name.

The following example shows the command syntax.

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-delete POLICY (PLAN1 PLAN2 ...) [--output JSON] [-f, --force] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

The following example deletes the backup plan `my-policy-plan-a` from the `my-new-policy-23` policy that is identified by its ID.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-delete r138-0521986d-963c-4c18-992d-d6a7a99d115f my-policy-plan-a
This will delete plan my-policy-plan-a and cannot be undone. Continue [y/N] ?> y
Deleting plan my-policy-plan-a under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
OK
Deletion request for plan my-policy-plan-a has been accepted.
```
{: screen}

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is backup-policy-plan-delete`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#backup-policy-plan-delete){: external}.

### Deleting a backup policy from the CLI
{: #backup-delete-policy-cli}
{: cli}

Run the `backup-policy-delete` command and specify the policy ID or policy name for one or more backup policies. Backup plans that are associated with the policy are also deleted. For more information about backup policy deletion, see [Backup policy deletion overview](#backup-delete).

```sh
ibmcloud is backup-policy-delete (POLICY1 POLICY2 ...) [--output JSON] [-f, --force] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

The following example is a request to delete a backup policy by name.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-delete  my-backup-policy-v1
This will delete backup policy my-backup-policy-v1 and can't be undone. Continue [y/N] ?> y
Deleting backup policy my-backup-policy-v1 under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
OK
Deletion request for backup policy my-backup-policy-v1 has been accepted.
```
{: screen}

The following example is a request to delete a backup policy by ID and provides the response in JSON format.

```json
$ ibmcloud is backup-policy-delete r138-5c719085-cf26-456e-9216-984866659e29 --output JSON
[
    {

        "result": true,
        "Error": null
    }
]
```
{: screen}

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is backup-policy-delete`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#backup-policy-delete).

### Deleting a backup plan with the API
{: #backup-delete-plan-api}
{: api}

Make a `DELETE /backup_policies/{backup_policy_id}/plans/{plan_id}` request to delete a specific backup plan from a backup policy. Resources that were created by the plan remain but they are no longer subject to the plan's deletion trigger. During the deletion, the status shows `deleting`. When the deletion is complete (status = `deleted`), the backup plan can't be recovered.

See the following example.

```sh
curl -X DELETE\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/backup_policies/5063bfe5-c16f-4606-ba26-fba0f099b97d/plans/4cf9171a-0043-4434-8727-15b53dbc374c?version=2022-06-28&generation=2"\
   -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: codeblock}

The response shows that the backup plan was deleted.

```json
{
  "active": true,
  "attach_user_tags": ["my-daily-backup-plan"],
  "copy_user_tags": true,
  "created_at": "2022-06-22T01:44:49.070Z",
