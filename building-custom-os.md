# Configuration requirements for custom Linux kernels
{: #configuration-requirements-for-custom-linux-kernels}

Custom Linux kernels can be used in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} VPC. You can build a custom kernel locally on your virtual server instance or on-premises. Use Image from Volume to capture an image by using your custom kernel, or use [Custom Image Import](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-importing-custom-images-vpc) to bring your on-premises image into the account's image catalog.

When you build your own custom Linux kernel for use in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}, refer to these requirements. It is also recommended that you [enable virtual server instance console access](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsi_is_connecting_console) when you build your own custom kernel. Doing so helps facilitate debugging any potential boot issues.

## Hardware requirements
{: #hardware-requirements-custom-linux-kernels}

Hardware that is supported by every virtual machine in IBM's VPC is detailed in the following device list. These devices are currently consistent for every virtual machine in the VPC and are subject to change as new features become available in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}. Custom kernels need to support these devices to run in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} VPC. Failure to include these kernels can result in loss of features or capabilities in the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}.

## Custom Linux kernel build options
{: #custom-linux-kernel-build-options}

The following kernel options are required when you build a Linux operating system for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}.

- CONFIG_ETHERNET = y
   - Ethernet driver support
- CONFIG_NETDEVICES = y
   - Network device support
- CONFIG_PCI = y
   - Enables support for the PCI local bus, including support for PCI-X and the foundations for PCI Express support
- CONFIG_NET = y
   - Networking support
- CONFIG_KVM_GUEST = y
   - Enables various optimizations to run under the KVM hypervisor - including a paravirtualized clock. So that instead of relying on a PIT (or other) emulation by the underlying device model
- CONFIG_SCSI_MOD = y
   - SCSI device support
- CONFIG_SCSI = y
   - To use a SCSI hard disk, SCSI tape drive, SCSI CD-ROM, or any other SCSI device under Linux
- CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI = y
   - This driver adds support for virtio-based para virtual device drivers over PCI
- CONFIG_SCSI_VIRTIO = y
   - The virtual HBA driver for virtio
- CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET = y
   - The virtual network driver for virtio


## Hardware requirements for LinuxONE (s390x processor architecture)
{: #hardware-requirements-linuxone}

The following hardware is provided for LinuxONE (s390x processor architecture).

- VIRTIO_BLK
- VIRTIO_NET
- IBM z15
- Virtual ASCII console
- Virtual channel subsystem


## Custom Linux kernel build options for LinuxONE (s390x processor architecture)
{: #custom-linux-kernel-linuxone-options}

The following kernel options are required:

- CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=Y
   - Block device support
- CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=Y
   - Network device support
- CONFIG_S390_GUEST=Y
   - KVM guest handling, including virtio-ccw
- CONFIG_SCLP_VT220_TTY=Y
   - tty on virtual ascii console
- CONFIG_SCLP_VT220_CONSOLE=Y
   - Boot console on virtual ascii console

## Custom Linux kernel build options for bare metal servers
{: #custom-linux-kernel-bare-metal-servers}

The custom image that you create for bare metal servers must support the following:
* UEFI boot
   *  Legacy BIOS boot is not supported. As such, you need a dedicated EFI partition that contains the EFI firmware.
* Intel chipset device drivers.
* Bare Metal servers require the pensando ionic device driver for networking. This driver is normally an in-box driver for 5.x linux kernels. If the ionic driver is not part of your kernel, you can include it as a kernel module and use DKMS to manage kernel upgrades.

To create secure execution-based custom images by using the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} option, see [Preparing the workload](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=execution-workload-owner-tasks).
