# Lifecycle for guest operating systems
{: #guest-os-lifecycle}

In the lifecycle of an operating system, end of support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. A notification is sent out 90 days before support for an operating system is withdrawn.
{: shortdesc}

If you are using a generic operating system custom image, refer to your vendor documentation for EOS dates. For more information, see [Generic operating system custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images#generic-os-custom-images).

| Image status | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `available` | The most current version of the stock operating system image is `available`. When a new version of an operating system is made `available`, the older version image of that guest operating system changes to `deprecated`. No stock operating system that reaches EOS has an `available` image. |
| `deprecated` | Older versions of stock operating systems are `deprecated`. Also, any stock operating system that reached EOS is also `deprecated`. The UI doesn't display any `deprecated` images when creating an instance. These images are still visible in the CLI and API. |
{: caption="Table 1. Image lifecycle status" caption-side="bottom"}

If you choose to continue to use a `deprecated` stock operating system image after EOS, review the [End of support operating system considerations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-eos-os-considerations-intro).
