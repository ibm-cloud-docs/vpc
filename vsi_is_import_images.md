# Importing and validating custom images into VPC
{: #importing-custom-images-vpc}

You can create your own custom image on premises and then import it to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} infrastructure from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}. Then, you can use your custom image to create a new virtual server instance that runs on the KVM hypervisor. If you plan to use your custom image in a private catalog, you must first import the custom image into {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} and validate it.
{: shortdesc}

You can also create a custom image of a boot volume that is attached to a server at import time. For more information, see [About creating an image from volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc).
{: note}

## Prerequisites
{: #pre-req-import-custom-image-cloud-object-storage}

To complete this task, you must have an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} available. You must also create an authorization so that the Image Service for VPC can access images in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Granting access to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} to import and export images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-object-storage-prereq).

{{site.data.content.custom-image-requirements-list}}

Keep the following considerations in mind when you import a custom image:

* When you use a custom image, you are responsible for any updates to the image.
* Support for any custom image software must be obtained directly from the vendor who provided the image.
* You can restrict which types of servers that you can can provision from your custom image by setting an allowed-use expression on the image. For more information about allowed-use expressions, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui)
* When you import a custom image, it's private to the account where you import it.
* The region where you choose to import the image is the region where you can create virtual servers from that image.
* For custom images with Red Hat Enterprise Linux&reg; or Windows&reg; operating systems, you must select the appropriate version of the operating system. Depending on how you configured the image, select either bring your own license `byol`, or if you plan to license the OS through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, select the version without `byol` appended.

For more information about custom images, see [Getting started with custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images).

## Importing a custom image by using the UI
{: #import-custom-image-cloud-object-storage-ui}
{: ui}

When you have an image available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can import it to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

1. Make sure that your compatible custom image is available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. To upload an image to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, on the **Objects** page of your bucket, click **Upload**. You can use the Aspera high-speed transfer plug-in to upload images larger than 200 MB. For more information, see [Creating a Linux custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-linux-custom-image), [Creating a Windows custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-windows-custom-image), [Bring your own license](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-byol-vpc-about) and [Uploading data](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}.
1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Images**.
1. On the **Custom images** tab, click **Create**.
1. Complete the fields that are described in Table 1 and click **Create Custom Image**.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Location | Select the specific geographic area and region where you want your custom image to be available for provisioning.|
| Name  | A name is required for your custom image. |
| Resource group | Select a resource group for the custom image. |
| Tags |  You can assign a label to this resource so that you can easily filter resources in your resource list. |
| Source | Select **Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}** as the source. A list displays from which you select an {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance where the image that you want to import is stored. \n Do you need to create a custom image from a volume instead? Select the source for the custom image by choosing either **Virtual server instance boot volume** or **Block storage boot volume**. For more information, see [Creating an image from a volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-ifv). |
| Location | Select the specific geographic region where your image is stored. |
| Bucket | Select the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket where your image is stored.|
| Name | Select the image file in the {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} service instance that you want to import. If you are importing an encrypted image, the image must be encrypted with LUKS encryption by using QEMU and your own passphrase. For more information, see [Encrypting the image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image#manually-encrypt-image). |
| Operating System | Select the operating system that is included in your image. \n \n For custom images with Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Windows operating systems, you can bring your own license (BYOL) or license through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. \n \n For Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Windows [BYOL custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-byol-vpc-about), you must select the OS with `-byol` appended to the name. For example, if you have a Windows 2019 BYOL custom image, select *windows-2019-amd64-byol* for the operating system. Failure to select the `-byol` version of the operating system when you import a BYOL custom image might result in a virtual server that is unable to start. \n \n If you configured your Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Windows custom image to license through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must select the non-BYOL operating system. For example, if you have a Windows 2019 custom image that you plan to license through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, select *windows-2019-amd64* as the operating system when you import the custom image. \n \n For a custom image that uses a generic OS, select `Generic` and then select the appropriate version. \n \n **Notes:** \n \n * For a custom image by using an operating system not listed in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you must create a custom image that uses a generic OS. For more information, see [Creating a generic operating system custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-generic-os-custom-image&interface=ui). \n \n * Select the ESXi kickstart version if your image requires that technology to boot and initialize. However, this option is only available for bare metal servers. |
| Encryption | The default selection is **Provider-managed**. If you have not encrypted your image by using QEMU, use the default value, **Provider-managed**. If you are importing an image that you have encrypted by using QEMU and your own passphrase, select the key management service where your customer root key (CRK) that protects your passphrase is stored. Select either **Key Protect** or **Hyper Protect Crypto Services**. VHD format images are not supported for encryption. |
| Encryption service instance | For an encrypted image, select the specific instance of the key management service where your CRK that wraps your encryption passphrase is stored. For more information, see [Setting up your key management service and keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image#kms-prereqs). |
| Key name | Select the customer root key (CRK) that you used to wrap your encryption passphrase. For more information, see [Setting up your key management service and keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image#kms-prereqs). |
| Wrapped data encryption key | For an encrypted image, specify the ciphertext that is associated with the wrapped data encryption key (WDEK). The WDEK is produced by wrapping the passphrase that you used to encrypt your image with your customer root key. For more information, see [Setting up your key management service and keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image#kms-prereqs).|
| Set allowed-use expressions (optional) | You can use an allowed-use expression with your custom image to define the capabilities and restrictions of an image and help you find compatible image and profile combinations during server creation. To include allowed-use expressions, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui). |
| Manage image lifecycle (optional) | Select to schedule status changes for the image. You can schedule a single status change or schedule the complete lifecycle of the image. The image statuses are:  \n  \n * `available`: The image can be used to create an instance.  \n  \n * `deprecated`: The image is still available to use to provision an instance. Using the `deprecated` status can discourage use of the image before the status changes to `obsolete`.  \n * `obsolete`: The image is not available to use to provision an instance.  \n  \n * Schedule complete lifecycle: You can schedule both the `deprecated` and `obsolete` status changes at the same time.  \n  \n You can move back and forth between the three statuses. Only the statuses you can change to are displayed. You can schedule status changes by using calendar date and time or number of days. The obsolescence date must always be after the deprecation date. |

## Importing a custom image by using the CLI
{: #import-custom-image-cloud-object-storage-cli}
{: cli}

Make sure that your compatible custom image is available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Creating a Linux custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-linux-custom-image), [Creating a Windows custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-windows-custom-image), [Creating a generic operating system custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-generic-os-custom-image), [Bring your own license](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-byol-vpc-about) and [Uploading data](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. To include allowed-use expressions, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui).

When you have an image available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can import it to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure by using the command-line interface (CLI).

To import a custom image by using the CLI, use the **`ibmcloud is image-create`** command. Specify the name of the custom image to be created by using the `IMAGE_NAME` variable. The name can't be used by another image in the region and names that start with `ibm-` are reserved for system-provided images. You must also specify the source; for example, specify the `--file` option with the image file location. Specify the `--os-name` option with the name of the operating system for the image.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-create IMAGE_NAME [--file IMAGE_FILE_LOCATION] [--os-name OPERATING_SYSTEM_NAME]
```
{: pre}

The following example creates a custom image with the name of `my-ubuntu-16-amd64`. The image source location is `cos://us-south/custom-image-vpc-bucket/customImage-0.qcow2`. The operating system is `ubuntu-16-amd64`.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-create my-ubuntu-16-amd64 --file cos://us-south/custom-image-vpc-bucket/customImage-0.qcow2 --os-name ubuntu-16-amd64
```
{: pre}

For more information, see [ibmcloud is image-create](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#image-create) in the VPC CLI reference page.

### Schedule custom image lifecycle status changes by using the CLI
{: #import-schedule-ilm-status-change-cli}

When you import a custom image by using the command-line interface (CLI), you can also schedule the lifecycle status changes of an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image at the same time by using options of the **`ibmcloud is image-create`** command.

Specify the name of the custom image to be created by using the `IMAGE_NAME` variable. The name can't be used by another image in the region and names that start with `ibm-` are reserved for system-provided images. You must also specify the source; for example, specify the `--file` option with the image file location. Specify the `--os-name` option with the name of the operating system for the image.

To schedule the `deprecate-at` or `obsolete-at` properties, specify a date in the ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`) date and time format.

* `YYYY` is the four-digit year
* `MM` is the two-digit month
* `DD` is the two-digit day
* `T` separates the date and time information
* `hh` is the two-digit hours
* `mm` is the two-digit minutes
* `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` is the Coordinated Universal Time time zone

Thus, the date of 30 September 2023 at 8:00 PM in the North American Central Standard time zone (CST) would be `2023-09-30T20:00:00-06:00`

When you schedule the date and time, you can't use your current date and time or a future date and time. For example, if it is 8 AM on 12 June, then the scheduled date and time must be after 8 AM on 12 June. If you define both the `deprecate-at` and `obsolete-at` dates and times, the `deprecate-at` date must be after the `obsolete-at` date and time.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-create IMAGE_NAME [--file IMAGE_FILE_LOCATION] [--os-name OPERATING_SYSTEM_NAME] [--deprecate-at YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm] [--obsolete-at YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm]
```
{: pre}

The following example creates a custom image with the name of `my-ubuntu-16-amd64`. The image source location is `cos://us-south/custom-image-vpc-bucket/customImage-0.qcow2`. The operating system is `ubuntu-16-amd64`. The image is scheduled to be deprecated on `2023-03-01T06:11:28+05:30`. The image is scheduled to be obsolete on `2023-12-31T06:11:28+05:30`.

```sh
ibmcloud is image-create my-ubuntu-16-amd64 --file cos://us-south/custom-image-vpc-bucket/customImage-0.qcow2 --os-name ubuntu-16-amd64 --deprecate-at 2023-03-01T06:11:28+05:30 --obsolete-at 2023-12-31T06:11:28+05:30
```

## Importing a custom image by using the API
{: #import-custom-image-cloud-object-storage-api}
{: api}

Make sure that your compatible custom image is available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. For more information, see [Creating a Linux custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-linux-custom-image), [Creating a Windows custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-windows-custom-image), [Creating a generic operating system custom image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-generic-os-custom-image), [Bring your own license](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-byol-vpc-about), and [Uploading data](/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-upload) to {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. To include an allowed-use expression, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui).

When you have an image available in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}, you can import it to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure by using the application programming interface (API).

To import a custom image by using the API, use [Create an image](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-image).

The `name` can't be used by another image in the region and names that start with `ibm-` are reserved for system-provided images. Specify the `file.href` subproperty with the location of the image. Specify the `operating_system.name` subproperty with the name of the image operating system.

Generic operating system custom images is a beta feature that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. The generic operating systems have `family` of `Generic`. Be sure to select the one with `allow_user_image_creation` value of `true` and the `user_data_format` needed for your operating system to boot and initialize correctly. For more information, see [User data format considerations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images#custom-image-user-data-format).
{: beta}

The following example imports a custom image with the name of `my-image`, source location of `cos://us-south/my-bucket/my-image.qcow2`, and the operating system for the image is `debian-9-amd64`.

```sh
curl -X POST "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/images?version=2023-02-21&generation=2" -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token" -d '{
      "name": "my-image",

      },
      "operating_system": {
        "name": "debian-9-amd64"
      }
    }'
```
{: pre}

### Schedule custom image lifecycle status changes by using the API
{: #import-schedule-ilm-status-change-API}

When you import a custom image by using the application programming interface (API), you can also schedule the lifecycle status changes of an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image at the same time by using the [Create an image](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-image) command.

The `name` can't be used by another image in the region and names that start with `ibm-` are reserved for system-provided images. Specify the `file.href` subproperty with the location of the image. Specify the `operating_system.name` subproperty with the name of the image operating system.

To schedule the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` properties, specify a date in the ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`) date and time format.

* `YYYY` is the four-digit year
* `MM` is the two-digit month
* `DD` is the two-digit day
* `T` separates the date and time information
* `hh` is the two-digit hours
* `mm` is the two-digit minutes
* `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` is the Coordinated Universal Time time zone

Thus, the date of 30 September 2023 at 8:00 PM in the North American Central Standard time zone (CST) would be `2023-09-30T20:00:00-06:00`

When you schedule the date and time, you can't use your current date and time. For example, if it is 8 AM on 12 June, then the scheduled date and time must be after 8 AM on 12 June. If you define both the `deprecation_at` and `obsolescence_at` dates and times, the `obsolescence_at` date must be after the `deprecation_at` date and time.

The following example imports a custom image with the name of `my-image`, source location of `cos://us-south/my-bucket/my-image.qcow2`, and the operating system for the image is `debian-9-amd64`. The image is scheduled to be deprecated on `2023-03-01T06:11:28+05:30`. The image is scheduled to be obsolete on `2023-12-31T06:11:28+05:30`.

## Schedule custom image lifecycle status changes by using Terraform
{: #import-schedule-ilm-status-change-terraform}
{: terraform}

When you import a custom image by using Terraform, you can also schedule the lifecycle status changes of an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} custom image at the same time by using the Terraform resource command [ibm_is_image](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_image){: external}.

The `name` attribute can't be used by another image in the region and names that start with `ibm-` are reserved for system-provided images.

To schedule the `deprecation_at` or `obsolescence_at` attributes, specify a date in the ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm`) date and time format.

* `YYYY` is the four-digit year
* `MM` is the two-digit month
* `DD` is the two-digit day
* `T` separates the date and time information
* `hh` is the two-digit hours
* `mm` is the two-digit minutes

When you schedule the date and time, you can't use your current date and time. For example, if it is 8:00 AM on 12 June, then the scheduled date and time must be after 8:00 AM on 12 June. If you define both the `deprecation_at` and `obsolescence_at` dates and times, the `obsolescence_at` date must be after the `deprecation_at` date and time.

The following example imports a custom image with the name of `example-image`, source location of `cos://us-south/buckettesttest/livecd.ubuntu-cpc.azure.vhd`, and the operating system for the image is `ubuntu-16-04-amd64`. The image is scheduled to be deprecated on `2023-11-28T15:10:00.000Z`. The image is scheduled to be obsolete on `2023-11-28T15:10:00.000Z`.

* Schedule a status change to `deprecated`.

## Validating an imported custom image by using the UI
{: #validate-custom-images-cloud-object-storage-ui}
{: ui}

After you import a custom image, you can view the checksum that was generated for the image when it is imported to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.

If you generate a checksum locally for your image before you import it, you can compare the two checksums to make sure that they are identical. Matching checksums indicate that the image is unaltered.

1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Images**.
2. On the **Custom images** tab, from your list of custom images, click the name of the custom image that you want to validate.
3. In the image details side panel, locate the **Checksum (SHA256)** field. You see content similar to, *6809606da67eb83670e6249e54e94043eb43c0471669fb96ea4050c4c07e2df7*.

   *For z/OS Wazi aaS custom image only:* You cannot validate the checksum of the imported custom images that are deployed from Wazi Image Builder.
   {: note}

4. Compare the Checksum (SHA256) value to the output that is generated when you calculate a checksum for the image locally.

   * Example Linux command: `sha256sum ubuntu_image.qcow2`
   * Example Mac command: `shasum -a 256 ubuntu_image.qcow2`
   * You receive output similar to: `6809606da67eb83670e6249e54e94043eb43c0471669fb96ea4050c4c07e2df7`

Compare the returned Checksum (SHA256) value to the output that is generated when you calculate a checksum for the image locally.

   * Example Linux command: `sha256sum ubuntu_image.qcow2`
   * Example Mac command: `shasum -a 256 ubuntu_image.qcow2`
   * You receive output similar to: `6809606da67eb83670e6249e54e94043eb43c0471669fb96ea4050c4c07e2df7`

After you validate the Checksum (SHA256), use the image to create a virtual server. See [Creating a virtual server instance by using the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=cli).

## Validating an imported custom image by using the API
{: #validate-custom-images-cloud-object-storage-api}
{: api}

After you import a custom image, you can view the checksum that was generated for the image when it is imported to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.

If you generate a checksum locally for your image before you import it, you can compare the two checksums to make sure that they are identical. Matching checksums indicate that the image is unaltered.

To validate as custom image by using the API, use [List all images](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-images).

For the `$image_id`, specify the ID of the custom image you want to validate.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/images/$image_id/?version=2023-02-21&generation=2" -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```

## Next steps
{: #next-validate-custom-image}

After you validate the custom images, you can deploy and manage your custom images. For more information, see [Managing custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-custom-images&interface=ui).

If you plan to manage your custom images with a private catalog, see [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui). If you plan to publish your images through the Global Catalog and bill users by using a software plan, see [Onboarding a virtual server for VPC with a plan](/docs/account?topic=account-working-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui).
