# FAQ for virtual private endpoints
{: #faqs-vpe}

You might encounter the following frequently asked questions when you use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) for VPC.

## Can I map {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services to a VPE from the service catalog?
{: #faq-cannot-map-services}
{: faq}
{: support}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services cannot be mapped to a VPE from the service catalog during the time of purchase.

## Can I map an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service to a Public endpoint?
{: #faq-map-cloud-service-public-endpoint}
{: faq}
{: support}

Public endpoints of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services are not eligible for VPE. VPE can be mapped only to a private endpoint of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.

## Is a VPE created in high-availability mode?
{: #faq-vpe-ha-mode}
{: faq}
{: support}

A VPE is not created in high-availability (HA) mode, by default. HA comes primarily from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service.

## Can I access an IBM Cloud service by using a private service endpoint IP address?
{: #faq-access-using-cse-adn}
{: faq}
{: support}

When an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service is created, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} DNS Services are automatically set up to resolve the IBM Cloud service FQDN to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private service address.

When a VPE is created, VPE assigns a reserved IP with which you can access the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. It is recommended to use the reserved IP instead of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private service endpoint.

## Does mapping an IBM Cloud service to an IP address on a VPC network make the service private?
{: #faq-map-cloud-service-make-service-private}
{: faq}

Mapping an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service to an IP address on a VPC network does not make the service private. For example, if a service has
a public endpoint, you can still access the public endpoint after the service is mapped.

## Does controlling access to an IP on a VPC network that is mapped to a service control access to the mapped service?
{: #faq-access-mapped-service}
{: faq}

Controlling access to an IP address on a VPC network that is mapped to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service does not control the access to the mapped service itself.

## Is there a limit to the number of IP addresses I can bind to an endpoint gateway?
{: #faq-reserved-ips-and-number-ports}
{: faq}

When the reserved IP address that is bound to the endpoint gateway is source NATed on the VPC gateway, it is done by using IP masquerading on the port. As the number of IP addresses bound to the endpoint gateway grows, the number of available ports to masquerade might become a concern.

## How many IP addresses can I use for NAT operations on the VPC gateway?
{: #faq-ip-nat-operations}
{: faq}

A finite pool of IP addresses is used for NAT operations on the VPC gateway. One IP address is required per VPC per zone.
