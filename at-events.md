# Activity tracking events for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}
{: #at_events}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, generate activity tracking events.
{: shortdesc}

Activity tracking events report on activities that change the state of resources in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and also report on certain activities that do not change any state, such as attempts to access and update resources. You can use the events to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements.

You can use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

### DNS resolution binding events
{: #events-dns-resolution-bindings}

The following table lists the actions that are related to DNS resolution bindings.

| Resource  | Action  | Description  |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| DNS resolution binding | is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.create | Creates a DNS resolution binding. Generates events for both hub VPC and DNS-shared VPCs. |
| DNS resolution binding | is.vpc.dns-resolution-binding.update | Updates the name of a DNS resolution binding. |

{: caption="Actions that generate events for DNS resolution bindings" caption-side="bottom"}

Although the DNS resolution binding is created or deleted by the DNS-shared VPC authorized user, the system is creating or deleting the DNS resolution binding objects for both the hub VPC and DNS-shared VPCs. Therefore, the system also generates the activity tracking event for both hub and DNS-shared VPCs.
{: note}

Existing events include a new attribute:

`is.vpc.vpc.{create,update}`
:    Includes a `dns` property and its object value in request data.

`is.vpc.vpc.{read,list}`
:    Includes a `dns` property and its object value in response data.

`is.endpoint-gateway.endpoint-gateway.{create,update}`
:    Includes an `allow_dns_resolution_binding property` and its boolean value in both request and response data.

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Auditing events that are generated by VPC resources are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location. The service can route the events to a target storage location that you define. The target can be an [{{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-target_v2_cos), an [{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-target_v2_icl), or an [{{site.data.keyword.messagehub_full}} target](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-target_v2_ies&interface=cli). For more information, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}}](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance. For information on accessing the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} UI, see [Navigating to the UI](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-launch) in the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} documentation.

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_iam_analyze}

Refer to the following information when you are analyzing events:

- {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} actions are set to `read` for both the GET and LIST calls, for example, `is.instance.instance.read`. However, for the LIST calls, the `target.name` field is set to `*`, whereas for the GET calls, it is set to the name of the resource. {: #at-protocol-state-filtering}

- To determine whether a virtual network interface is created with the protocol state filtering feature, look for the `protocol_state_filtering_mode` field in the AT events `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.create` or `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.update`. Values are as follows:

   - `0` sets the mode to Auto, which enables or disables filtering based on your VNI's target resource type. If the target type is a bare metal server or Elba virtual server instance, filtering is disabled; for other virtual server instances or a file share mount, filtering is enabled.
   - `1` enables protocol state filtering.
   - `2` disables protocol state filtering.

   For more information, see [Protocol state filtering mode](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about#protocol-state-filtering).
   {: note}

- When a user triggers an instance action change, an activity tracking log is generated. The action is specified to one of the following valid action types: `start`, `stop`, and `reboot`.

- The `target` field contains information about the top-level resources, for example, VPC, subnets, and instances (virtual machine). For subresources, such as volume-attachments and security-group rules, their unique identifier can be found from the `responseData.responseURI` field. The mapping to the parent resources is reflected by the URI.

- For events that are related to volume-attachments, the ID of the volume that was attached can be found indirectly by getting the ID of the volume-attachment from the `target.responseURI` field (which also contains the instance ID), and by using that ID to query the corresponding `GET /instance/{instance_id}/volume-attachment/{volume-attachment-id}` API. The volume ID can be found from the response of the GET API call.

- For events that are related to Load Balancer requests, consider the following information:

    You can get more data in the `requestData.requestPath` field. You can find details about a subresource such as a listener ID or rule ID.

    When you create resources, you can get IDs from the `responseData.responseContent` field.

    For update actions, the original value is not included. You can do a read action to get the value before you run an update on the resource.

- The following fields for Bare Metal Servers for VPC AT events are changing between the Beta and LA releases:

   1) The `severity` field in Beta events is not consistent with general practice within VPC and is corrected in the LA release.

   2) The `target resourceGroupID` field in Beta events does not include the CRN prefix. This item is corrected in the LA release.

   3) Some Beta events include array data. If the array is too large, the event isn't recorded. For LA, these events display an array element count rather than the actual data.

- Each time that you open a console for a virtual server instance or bare metal server, two API calls are issued: the first one generates a console access token, the second one uses the generated token to open the console websocket.

   This API call generates two activity tracking events: `is.instance.console-access-token.create` and `is.instance.console.read`, or `is.bare-metal-server.console-access-token.create` and `is.bare-metal-server.console.read`.

   You cannot use `request id` to correlate console activity tracking events as each call generates a unique `request id`. Instead, you can use `initiator id` to correlate console events that are generated from API calls issued by the same user.

- You can find the detailed information and fields included in the requestData and responseData for the Bare Metal Servers for VPC AT events in the [API documentation](/apidocs/vpc/latest).
