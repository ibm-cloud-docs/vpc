# VPC API change log
{: #api-change-log}

Read the VPC API change log to learn about updates and improvements to the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) [API](/apidocs/vpc). The change log lists changes that are ordered by the date they were released. Changes to existing API versions are designed to be compatible with existing client applications.
{: shortdesc}

By design, new features with backward-incompatible changes apply only to version dates on and after the feature's release. Changes that apply to older versions of the API are designed to maintain compatibility with existing applications and code. If backward-incompatible changes require non-trivial client code changes to use an API version, the API change log might provide links to instructions, tips, or best practices for updating client code.
{: note}

Some changes, such as new response properties or new optional request parameters, are considered backward compatible. Other changes, such as new required request parameters, are not considered backward compatible. To avoid disruption from changes to the API, use the following best practices when you call the API:

- Catch and log any `4xx` or `5xx` HTTP status code, along with the included `trace` property
- Follow HTTP redirect rules for any `3xx` HTTP status code
- Consume only the resources and properties your application needs to function
- Avoid depending on behavior that is not explicitly documented

SDK changes are based on API changes. For more information about the latest changes to the VPC SDKs, see the change logs in the SDK repositories:

- [Java SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-java-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Node SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-node-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Python SDK change log](https://github.com/IBM/vpc-python-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Upcoming changes
{: #upcoming-changes}

**Deprecated `classic_access` for VPCs.** When [creating a VPC](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc), the `classic_access` property is now deprecated. Instead, use a [Transit Gateway](/docs/transit-gateway) to connect VPCs to Classic Infrastructure.

In an upcoming release, unless your account has been granted approval, you will no longer be able to create a new VPC with `classic_access` set to `true`. To prepare for this change, update your workflows to use Transit Gateways instead of the `classic_access` property.

**`InstanceTemplate` response schema change.** In an upcoming release, future methods of creating instances, and therefore creating instance templates, may not require a primary network interface. To accommodate this, the `primary_network_interface` property is now optional in the instance template response model. 

At this time, all instances, and therefore all instance templates, continue to require that a primary network interface be specified. Therefore, existing instance templates are unaffected. Additionally, new instance templates will continue to include a primary network interface until further notice. However, to ensure your clients will not be affected in the future, verify that they are tolerant of the `primary_network_interface` property not being included when consuming `InstanceTemplate` responses.
{: important}

**Asynchronous `DELETE` response code change.** In an upcoming release, the response code output for asynchronous `DELETE` operations will change from `204` to `202`. A response code of `204` implies the action is completed, which could be misleading for operations that are still processing. A response code of `202` is more appropriate. This behavior change will occur only for an API version date after its release. A response code of `204` will continue to be returned for API versions up to this version date.

The new response code will be rolled out gradually. Each phase of the rollout will be tied to a dated API version. These changes will be announced in future change log updates.

**AMD GPU instance profiles.** When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance), you can now specify a `profile` for a server with GPUs manufactured by AMD, such as `gx3d-208x1792x8mi300x`. Accordingly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instances) instances, the response may include a new `gpu.manufacturer` property value of `amd`. Similarly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles, the response may include a `gpu_manufacturer.values` property value of `amd`. For more information, see [AMD MI300X instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family&interface=ui#amd-mi300x-profiles).

**Load balancers as pool member targets.** You can now create [pool members](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-pool-members) that target other [load balancers](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers). When [creating a member in a load balancer pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool-member), you can now specify the identity of another load balancer as the `target`. When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-profiles) load balancer profiles, use the new `targetable_load_balancer_profiles` property to determine which load balancers that profile can target.

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) and [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers) load balancers, the response now includes an `attached_load_balancer_pool_members` property, which references any pool members targeting this load balancer.

**Load balancers as pool member targets.** Accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature can now create [pool members](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-pool-members) that target other [load balancers](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers). When [creating a member in a load balancer pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool-member), you can now specify the identity of another load balancer as the `target`. When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-profiles) load balancer profiles, use the new `targetable_load_balancer_profiles` property to determine which load balancers that profile can target.

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers) load balancers, the response now includes an `attached_load_balancer_pool_members` property, which references any pool members targeting this load balancer.

This feature is now generally available. See the [29 April 2025](#29-april-2025) announcement.

**SNI hostname support for application load balancers.** You can now [create a policy rule](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener-policy-rule) for a server name indication (SNI) hostname by specifying `sni_hostname` as the `type`. Moreover, when [creating a policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener-policy) you can now target another listener on the load balancer by specifying the listener as the policy's `target`. For more information, see [Policy-based load balancing](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-layer-7-load-balancing).

### For version `2025-04-08` or later
{: #version-2025-04-08}

**Load balancer listener policy schema property value change.** When [creating a policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener-policy) to target a pool using a `version` query parameter of `2025-04-08` or later,  the `action` value `forward_to_pool` must be used instead of `forward`. Similarly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer-listener-policy) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-listener-policies) policies using a `version` query parameter of `2025-04-08` or later,  the `action` value of `forward_to_pool` will be returned instead of `forward`. For migration guidance, see [Updating to the `2025-04-08` version (SNI hostname support for application load balancers)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2025-04-08-migration-alb-listener-policy). Requests using a `version` query parameter of `2025-04-07` or earlier are unchanged.

**Trust Domain Extensions for confidential computing.** In select regions, you can now enable [Intel&reg; Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc#confidential-computing-vpc-with-tdx). [Instance profiles](/apidocs/vpc#list-instance-profiles) that support TDX include `tdx` in their `confidential_compute_modes.values` property. To use TDX, specify a profile that supports it along with the `confidential_compute_mode` value of `tdx` when [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) an instance, or when [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) an instance template.

See [Confidential computing known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#confidential-computing-vpc-known-issues) for details regarding a known issue when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles in the Dallas (`us-south`) and Frankfurt (`eu-de`) regions.

**Intel accelerator instance profiles.** When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance), you can now specify a `profile` for a server with accelerators manufactured by Intel, such as `gx3d-160x1792x8gaudi3`. Accordingly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instances) instances, the response may also include a new `gpu.manufacturer` property value of `intel`. Similarly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles, the response may also include a `gpu_manufacturer.values` property value of `intel`. For more information, see [Intel Gaudi 3 instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family&interface=ui#gaudi-3-profiles).

**Adjustable bandwidth for block storage volumes.** You can now specify the `bandwidth` property when [creating a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume) with a profile that supports adjustable bandwidth. The specified `bandwidth` will set the maximum bandwidth for a volume. You can also specify the `bandwidth` property when [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) with volume attachments. Additionally, you can [update a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-volume) to change the `bandwidth` property after volume creation.

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volume-profiles) volume profiles, the response now includes a `bandwidth` property, which indicates whether the profile supports adjustable bandwidth, and the range of supported values. Presently, only volume profiles with a `storage_generation` of `2` support adjustable bandwidth. For more information, see [Storage known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#gen1-bandwidth-property-dependent).

**Failsafe policies for load balancer pools.** When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-load-balancer-pool) a load balancer pool, you can now specify the `failsafe_policy` property to manage potential failures in your environment. A failsafe policy includes an `action`, and depending on the action, may also require a `target` (such as a pool to forward requests to).

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-profiles) load balancer profiles, the response now includes a `failsafe_policy_actions` property, which indicates the default and supported actions for each load balancer profile (when known).  Similarly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers) load balancers, the `failsafe_policy_actions` property indicates the supported actions. For more information, see [Creating an application load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers&interface=api) and [Creating a public or private network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer&interface=api).

Before you create a pool for a Private Path network load balancer, review [Known limitations for Private Path network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-limitations#limitations-private-path-network-load-balancers) for information about `failsafe_policy.action` value behavior.

**Storage generation for block storage and block storage snapshots.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volume-profiles) volume profiles, the response now includes a `storage_generation` property to denote which [generation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#using-api-iops-profiles) of block storage will be created when that profile is selected to [create a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume). Likewise, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volumes) volumes, the `storage_generation` property is included in the response. For more information, see [Viewing available volume profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#using-api-iops-profiles).

When you [create a snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot), the snapshot inherits the `storage_generation` from the `source_volume` that the snapshot was created from. Similarly, when a volume is created from a snapshot, the volume inherits the `storage_generation` value from the snapshot. When you [retrieve](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-snapshot)
or [list](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-snapshots) snapshots, the `storage_generation` property is included in the response.

**File share snapshots.** You can now [create a snapshot for a file share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share-snapshot), a point-in-time copy of your file share data that is directly tied to the lifecycle of the file share. The initial snapshot that you take is a full backup of the share. Subsequent snapshots of the same share are incremental, capturing only the changes that occurred after the last snapshot was taken. [Deleting a file share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-share) deletes all of the snapshots associated with that file share. You can also [update a share snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-share-snapshot) to change its user tags, and you can [delete a share snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-share-snapshot), when it's no longer needed.

When you [create a share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share), you can now specify the `source_snapshot` property to create the new share with the data from that snapshot. When you [create a replica file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create-replication&interface=api), snapshots of the source file share are automatically copied to the replica, and as snapshots are created and deleted on the source, corresponding snapshots will be created and deleted on the replica.

For more information, see [About File Storage for VPC snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-snapshots-about&interface=api). See also [Storage known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#storage-vpc-known-issues).

**File share snapshot automation.** You can now automate the creation of file share snapshots by applying backup policies to file shares. When [creating a backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy) specify the `match_resource_type` property value as `share` to target file shares. File shares that have both a matching type and a matching user tag are subject to the backup policy. For more information, see [Backup service concepts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about&interface=api#backup-service-concepts).

**NVIDIA Hopper HGX H100 instance profiles.** When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance), a new `gx3d-160x1792x8h100` instance profile is available in select zones. This profile provides 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs that are tuned for AI workloads, such as inferencing, fine tuning, and large-scale training. For details, see [Accelerated profile family - Gen 3](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family#hopper-hgx-profiles).

**Cluster networks.** Cluster networks provide high-bandwidth, low-latency networking for workloads such as AI training and large-scale simulations. You can now [create cluster networks](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-cluster-network) using a [cluster network profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-cluster-network-profile), which defines the cluster network performance characteristics and capabilities. The [H100 cluster network profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=api#gpu) is the first cluster network profile being introduced. It provides a specialized network that implements the RoCEv2 protocol to enable remote direct memory access for your workloads that are running on the `gx3d-160x1792x8h100` instance profile.

When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) using a supported cluster profile, you can specify the new `cluster_network_attachments` property to connect the virtual server instance to your cluster network. Alternatively, you can [create cluster network attachments](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-cluster-network-attachment) on an existing instance that is in a `stopping` or `stopped` state. Additionally, when [creating an instance template](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) you can specify `cluster_network_attachments`.

**Instance profile schema changes.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles, the response includes the following new properties:

- `cluster_network_attachment_count` specifies the number of cluster network attachments supported for that instance profile.
- `supported_cluster_network_profiles` indicates the cluster network profiles that are supported for that instance profile.

Learn [about cluster networks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cluster-network), cluster network subnets, cluster network interfaces, and explore the new [API methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-cluster-networks). See also [Known issues and limitations for cluster networks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-limitations-cluster-network) for information about Activity Tracker events.

**Reservations for bare metal servers.** You can now purchase a [capacity reservation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc&interface=ui) for a specified bare metal server profile in a specified zone. Reservations provide resources for future deployments and cost savings over the life of the term within the availability zone of your choice.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-reservation) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-reservation) a reservation, specify the `capacity.total` and `committed_use.term` properties to use for this reservation. Optionally specify the `committed_use.expiration_policy` property to apply when the committed use term expires (default: `release`). Specify the `profile.name` and `profile.resource_type` properties of the profile, and the `zone` property to use for this reservation. After you confirm the reservation is configured the way you want it, you must [activate the reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#activate-reservation). The reservation cannot be deleted until the committed use term expires. To provision a bare metal server using a reservation's capacity, specify the reservation using the `reservation_affinity.pool` property when [creating the bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server). You can also [update a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-bare-metal-server) that's been provisioned to associate it with a reservation.

When [retrieving a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-bare-metal-server), the new `reservation_affinity` property indicates the reservation affinity policy in effect for the bare metal server. The new `health_state` property indicates the bare metal server's overall health state, while an accompanying `health_reasons` property indicates the reason for any unhealthy health states, such as a failed reservation.

For more information, see [Provisioning reserved capacity for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-provisioning-reserved-capacity-vpc&interface=api).

**Reservation automatic attachment support.** You can now [automatically attach](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-automatic-reservation-vpc) a reservation when [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [creating a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server). Additionally, when [updating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) or [updating a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-bare-metal-server), you can change the `reservation_affinity.policy` to `automatic` for the instance or bare metal server to automatically attach to available reserved capacity.

When [creating a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-reservation), you can now specify an `affinity_policy` of `restricted` to prevent the policy from being used for automatic attachments. Similarly, while a reservation's `status` is `inactive`, you can [update a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-reservation) to be restricted.

For more information, see [Automatic attachments for reservations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-automatic-reservation-vpc).

### For version `2024-11-19` or later
{: #version-2024-11-19}

**Reservation affinity policy default.** When using a `version` query parameter of `2024-11-19` or later, the `reservation_affinity.policy` defaults to `automatic` when [creating a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/2024-11-19#create-reservation). Similarly, when using a `version` query parameter of `2024-11-19` or later, the `reservation_affinity.policy` defaults to `automatic` when [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/2024-11-19#create-instance) or [creating a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/2024-11-19#create-bare-metal-server). The behavior remains unchanged when using a `version` query parameter of `2024-11-18` or earlier.

## 12 November 2024

**Private Path network load balancers.** You can now create a [Private Path network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ppnlb-ui-creating-private-path-network-load-balancer&interface=api) to enable and manage private connectivity for consumers of a hosted service. When [creating a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer), you can specify the new `is_private_path` property value as `true` to create a Private Path network load balancer.

**Load balancer schema enhancements for Private Path network load balancers.** The Private Path network load balancer includes a new load balancer profile `network-private-path`, along with the following new load balancer and load balancer profile properties:

- `source_ip_session_persistence_supported` indicates whether a load balancer supports source IP session persistence. Source IP session persistence is not supported by Private Path network load balancers.
- `availability` indicates the availability of a load balancer. Load balancers with `subnet` availability remain available if at least one of its subnets is in a zone that's available. Load balancers with `region` availability remain available if at least one zone in the region is available. Private Path network load balancers have `region` availability. Other load balancers have `subnet` availability.

The `value` for load balancer profiles properties `route_mode_supported`, `security_groups_supported`, `udp_supported`, and `logging_supported` is set to `false` for Private Path load balancers. Additionally, Private Path load balancers do not support setting or updating the `dns` property, because Private Path network load balancers are accessed using endpoint gateways where DNS is configured.

**Private Path service gateways.** You can now [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-private-path-service-gateway) a Private Path service gateway to provide cross-account connectivity to the Private Path network load balancers that front your [services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-path-service-about&interface=api). Consumers access your services by targeting their endpoint gateways at your Private Path service gateways. You can also [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-private-path-service-gateway), [publish](/apidocs/vpc/latest#publish-private-path-service-gateway), [unpublish](/apidocs/vpc/latest#unpublish-private-path-service-gateway) or [delete](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-private-path-service-gateway) Private Path service gateways. Private Path service gateways also have two child resources:

- [Account policies](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateway-account-policies) provide per-account access policies that supersede the Private Path service gateway's default access policy. You can [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy), [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy), or [delete](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy) policies to `permit`, `deny`, or manually `review` requests from any account. You can also [revoke](/apidocs/vpc/latest#revoke-account-for-private-path-service-gateway) current and future access for an account. For more information, see [About account policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-pps-about-account-policies).

- [Endpoint gateway bindings](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gateway) are created for each endpoint gateway targeting the Private Path service gateway. The access policy for the endpoint gateway's account is applied to all new endpoint gateway bindings. If an account policy doesn't exist, the Private Path service gateway's `default_access_policy` is used. If the resulting policy is `review`, you must explicitly [permit](/apidocs/vpc/latest#permit-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gatew) or [deny](/apidocs/vpc/latest#deny-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gateway) the request, and optionally set a new policy for future requests from the account.

Learn about [Creating Private Path service gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-path-service-intro&interface=ui), and explore the new [API methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateways).

**Load balancer PUT response code change.** When [replacing load balancer pool members](/apidocs/vpc/latest#replace-load-balancer-pool-members), the response will now return an HTTP status code of `200` on success, instead of `202`. This change applies to all API versions.

This release introduces the following updates for accounts that have been granted special approval to preview and use these features. Although usage of these features is restricted, changes to schemas (such as new properties) will be visible to all accounts.

**NVIDIA Hopper HGX H100 instance profiles.** When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance), a new `gx3d-160x1792x8h100` instance profile is available in select zones. This profile provides 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs that are tuned for AI workloads, such as inferencing, fine tuning, and large-scale training. For details, see [Accelerated profile family - Gen 3](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-accelerated-profile-family#hopper-hgx-profiles).

**Cluster networks.** Cluster networks provide high-bandwidth, low-latency networking for workloads such as AI training and large-scale simulations. You can now [create cluster networks](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-cluster-network) using a [cluster network profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-cluster-network-profile), which defines the cluster network performance characteristics and capabilities. The [H100 cluster network profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=api#gpu) is the first cluster network profile being introduced. It provides a specialized network that implements the RoCEv2 protocol to enable remote direct memory access for your workloads that are running on the `gx3d-160x1792x8h100` instance profile.

When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) using a supported cluster profile, you can specify the new `cluster_network_attachments` property to connect the virtual server instance to your cluster network. Alternatively, you can [create cluster network attachments](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-cluster-network-attachment) on an existing instance that is in a `stopping` or `stopped` state. Additionally, when [creating an instance template](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) you can specify `cluster_network_attachments`.

**Instance profile schema changes.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles, the response includes the following new properties:

- `cluster_network_attachment_count` specifies the number of cluster network attachments supported for that instance profile.
- `supported_cluster_network_profiles` indicates the cluster network profiles that are supported for that instance profile.

Learn [about cluster networks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-cluster-network), cluster network subnets, cluster network interfaces, and explore the new [API methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-cluster-networks). See also [Known issues and limitations for cluster networks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-limitations-cluster-network) for information about Activity Tracker events and setting a cluster network reserved IP's `auto_delete` property.

The H100 profiles and cluster networks features are now generally available. See the announcement on [10 December 2024](#10-december-2024).

**Distributing traffic across tunnels of route-based VPN gateway connections.** You can now distribute traffic across tunnels with a `status` of `up` in a route-based VPN gateway connection. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpn-gateway-connection) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpn-gateway-connection) a route-based VPN gateway connection, set the `distribute_traffic` property to `true` (default is `false`). Existing connections will have the `distribute_traffic` property set to `false`. The `distribute_traffic` property is now included in the `VPNGatewayConnection` schema used in responses, for example when [retrieving a VPN gateway connection](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpn-gateway-connection).

**Private Path network load balancers.** Accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature can now create a [Private Path network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ppnlb-ui-creating-private-path-network-load-balancer&interface=api) to enable and manage private connectivity for consumers of a hosted service. When [creating a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer), you can specify the new `is_private_path` property value as `true` to create a Private Path network load balancer.

**Load balancer schema enhancements for Private Path network load balancers.** The Private Path network load balancer includes a new load balancer profile `network-private-path`, along with the following new load balancer and load balancer profile properties:

- `source_ip_session_persistence_supported` indicates whether a load balancer supports source IP session persistence. Source IP session persistence is not supported by Private Path network load balancers.
- `availability` indicates the availability of a load balancer. Load balancers with `subnet` availability remain available if at least one of its subnets is in a zone that's available. Load balancers with `region` availability remain available if at least one zone in the region is available. Private Path network load balancers have `region` availability. Other load balancers have `subnet` availability.

The `value` for load balancer profiles properties `route_mode_supported`, `security_groups_supported`, `udp_supported`, and `logging_supported` is set to `false` for Private Path load balancers. Additionally, Private Path load balancers do not support setting or updating the `dns` property, because Private Path network load balancers are accessed using endpoint gateways where DNS is configured.

**Private Path service gateways.** Accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature can now create a private path service gateway. [Creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-private-path-service-gateway), [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-private-path-service-gateway), [publishing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#publish-private-path-service-gateway), [unpublishing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#unpublish-private-path-service-gateway) and [deleting](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-private-path-service-gateway) Private Path service gateways provide cross-account connectivity to the Private Path network load balancers fronting your [services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-path-service-about&interface=api). Consumers access your services by targeting their endpoint gateways at your Private Path service gateways. Private Path service gateways also have two child resources:

- [Account policies](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateway-account-policies) provide per-account access policies that supersede the Private Path service gateway's default access policy. You can [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy), [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy), or [delete](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-private-path-service-gateway-account-policy) policies to `permit`, `deny`, or manually `review` requests from any account. You can also [revoke](/apidocs/vpc/latest#revoke-account-for-private-path-service-gateway) current and future access for an account. For more information, see [About account policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-pps-about-account-policies).

- [Endpoint gateway bindings](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gateway) are created for each endpoint gateway targeting the Private Path service gateway. The access policy for the endpoint gateway's account is applied to all new endpoint gateway bindings. If an account policy doesn't exist, the Private Path service gateway's `default_access_policy` is used. If the resulting policy is `review`, you must explicitly [permit](/apidocs/vpc/latest#permit-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gatew) or [deny](/apidocs/vpc/latest#deny-private-path-service-gateway-endpoint-gateway) the request, and optionally set a new policy for future requests from the account.

Learn about [Creating Private Path service gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-path-service-intro&interface=ui), and explore the new [API methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-private-path-service-gateways).

This feature is now generally available. See the "Private Path network load balancer" announcement on [12 November 2024](#12-november-2024).

**CRNs for VPC routing tables.** VPC routing tables now support the `crn` property as an identifier. As a result, the `RoutingTable`, `RoutingTableReference` and `RoutingTableIdentity` schemas now include a `crn` property. All operations that use these schemas have been updated. For operations where the response contains a routing table or a reference to a routing table, for example [creating a routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table), [retrieving a routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpc-routing-table) or [retrieving a VPC's default routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpc-default-routing-table), the `crn` property is now included. When [replacing the routing table for a subnet](/apidocs/vpc/latest#replace-subnet-routing-table), for example, you can now optionally specify the routing table by its `crn` property.

Now that all VPC routing tables have a CRN, you can [tag](/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=api) routing tables to [control access](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial), as well as [search](/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=api#search-tags-api-link) for VPC routing tables using tags.

**Sharing snapshots across accounts.** You can now use [cross-account authorization](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-s2s-auth&interface=api#block-s2s-xaccount-encryption-api) in Identity and Access Management ([IAM](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview)) to share a snapshot CRN with a target IBM account. Sharing allows that account to create a block storage volume from the shared snapshot. When [creating a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume), users who have been authorized within the target account can specify the `source_snapshot.crn` property with the CRN of the snapshot. When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volumes) volumes, the response includes `source_snapshot.remote.account` if the snapshot is from a different account.

For more information, see [Sharing a snapshot with another account](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-manage&interface=api#snapshots-vpc-s2s-api) and [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore&interface=api#snapshots-vpc-restore-API).

**Block storage `defined_performance` family.** For accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature, a new `defined_performance` family is introduced for data and boot [volumes](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume). This family initially contains the new [`sdp`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=ui#block-storage-sdp-intro) profile, which provides similar functionality to the existing `custom` volume profile. The `sdp` profile introduces the ability to increase capacity and change IOPS to volumes, even when those volumes are not attached to a virtual server instance. To make use of these capabilities in your automation, refer to **Block storage schema enhancements for adjustable capacity and IOPS.**

For more information, see [About Block Storage for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about), [Block Storage for VPC profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api), [Creating Block Storage for VPC volumes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage&interface=api), and [Viewing available volume profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#view-iops-profiles).

**Block storage schema enhancements for adjustable capacity and IOPS.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volume-profiles) volume profiles, the new `adjustable_capacity_states`, `adjustable_iops_states`, `boot_capacity`, `capacity`, and `iops` properties indicate the capacity and IOPS capabilities of the volume profile. While the capabilities of existing profiles are unchanged, accounts with access to the `defined_performance` profile family can use these properties in automation to robustly use the new capabilities. Similarly, when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volumes), volumes, the new `adjustable_capacity_states` and `adjustable_iops_states` properties indicate the adjustable capacity and IOPS capabilities of the volume.

**Zone universal names.** Unique identifiers for IBM Cloud zones are now available in the Geography API methods. When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-region-zone) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-region-zones)zones in a region, new properties `universal_name` and `data_center` are included in the response. A zone's `universal_name` is a persistent identifier of the zone, irrespective of the IBM Cloud account's [logical zone name mapping](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations#zone-mapping). The `data_center` property denotes the primary physical data center where the logical zone is hosted. This property lets you connect your VPC resources to your resources in IBM Classic data centers. If the `data_center` property is absent from the response, no physical data center has been assigned.

The response may also include a new zone `status` property value of `unassigned`, which indicates that the IBM Cloud account's zone mapping has not yet been assigned. For more information, see the overview [Region and data center locations for resource deployment](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations).

**Bare metal server reinitialization.** You can now [reinitialize](/apidocs/vpc/latest#replace-bare-metal-server-initialization) a bare metal server. To reinitialize a bare metal server, specify the `image` to provision, one or more SSH public `keys`, and optionally specify `user_data`. Upon successful reinitialization, the bare metal server starts automatically and retains the same physical node, interfaces, IP addresses, and resource IDs it had before reinitialization.

To reinitialize a bare metal server, the server `status` must be `stopped`, or have `failed` a previous reinitialization. For more information, see [Managing Bare Metal Servers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-bare-metal-servers&interface=api#reinitialize-bare-metal-servers-api).

**Parameterized redirect target URL for load balancers.** The `target.url` property now supports the variables `{protocol}`, `{port}`, `{host}`, `{path}`, and `{query}`, and embedding [RFC 6570 level 1 expressions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570#section-1.2){: external}. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener-policy) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-load-balancer-listener-policy) a policy for a load balancer listener, you can specify a value that contains a combination of these variables for the `target.url` property. This enables redirecting requests to a dynamic URL through the application load balancer. For more information, see [Layer 7 load balancing](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-layer-7-load-balancing#layer-7-policy-properties).

**Firmware update for bare metal servers.** You can now [update firmware](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-firmware-for-bare-metal-server) for a stopped bare metal server. This request updates server firmware if newer firmware is available and automatically starts the bare metal server after the firmware update is successfully completed. If you don't want the bare metal server to start after the® firmware is updated, set the `auto_start` property value to `false` in the request.

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-bare-metal-server) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-servers) bare metal servers, the response includes the new `firmware` property, which in turn has an `update` property that indicates the type of update available (`none`, `optional`, or `required`).

**Dynamic network bandwidth control for bare metal servers.** When [provisioning a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server), you can now optionally specify the `bandwidth` property according to the needs of your workload. You can subsequently [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-bare-metal-server) the `bandwidth` property of an existing bare metal server to support dynamic workload requirements. Bandwidth changes do not require a restart and are effective immediately. For more information, see [Creating Bare Metal Servers on VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-bare-metal-servers&interface=ui).

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-bare-metal-server-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-server-profiles) bare metal server profiles, the `bandwidth` property for new profiles can now return a `bandwidth.type` of `enum`, with `bandwidth.values` providing the supported bandwidth values, and `bandwidth.default` providing the profile's default bandwidth.

**Third generation of bare metal hardware profiles and Trusted Platform Module.** For accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature, when [creating a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server), the default TPM mode and the supported TPM modes will be determined by the profile. All third generation profiles will default to TPM 2.0 and will no longer support disabling TPM. For more information, see [Secure boot with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for bare metal servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-secure-boot-tpm&interface=ui) and [Creating Bare Metal Servers on VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-bare-metal-servers&interface=ui).

Provisioned bare metal servers are not affected. Existing bare metal server profiles are also not affected. Therefore, TPM remains disabled by default when provisioning servers using previous generations of bare metal server profiles.

**Accessor file shares.** You can now [create a share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share) that accesses data from [another share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-create&interface=api), which may be in another account. Specify the share to access data from, which may also be a replica share, with the new `origin_share` property.

Before specifying an origin share in another account, ensure that [authorizations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-s2s-auth&interface=api#file-s2s-auth-xaccount-api) are established between the origin share account and accessor account. You must also have an appropriate ([IAM](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview)) role with the `is.share.share.allow-remote-account-access` action.
{: requirement}

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-share) a share, specify the new `allowed_transit_encryption_modes` property (possible values `none`, `user_managed`) to limit the transit encryption modes for the share and its associated [accessor shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-create&interface=api#fs-create-accessor-mount-target-api).

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-share) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-shares) file shares, the `origin_share` property will be included in the response when the new `accessor_binding_role` is `accessor` (possible values `none`, `accessor`, `origin`).

Each time an accessor share is created, an accessor binding is created on its origin share, allowing all access to the origin share to be tracked and managed. The following new accessor bindings methods are introduced in this release:

- [List accessor bindings for an origin share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-share-accessor-bindings)
- [Retrieve an origin share accessor binding](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-share-accessor-binding)
- [Delete an origin share accessor binding](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-share-accessor-binding)

Revoking an account's access to an origin share requires both removing the accessor account's authorizations and [deleting](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-share-accessor-binding) its existing accessor bindings. For more information, see [Removing access to a file share from other accounts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=api).

Currently, when creating, updating or retrieving an accessor share, the `accessor_bindings` and `lifecycle_reasons` properties may be missing from the response. Additionally, when creating, updating, or retrieving an origin share, the value of the `href` sub-property of the `accessor_bindings` property may be incorrect.

**Generic operating system images.** You can now create a [generic operating system image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-generic-os-custom-image), which is an image containing a specific operating system that is not in the response from [listing operating systems](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-operating-systems). To facilitate creating these images and provisioning servers from them, two new immutable operating system properties, `user_data_format` and `allow_user_image_creation`, and one new immutable image property, `user_data_format`, are provided. The operating system property, `user_data_format` (possible values `cloud_init`, `esxi_kickstart`, `ipxe`), populates the image property, [`user_data_format`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images#custom-image-user-data-format), which specifies how `user_data` is interpreted and used when [creating a virtual server instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [creating a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server). The operating system property, `allow_user_image_creation`, indicates whether that operating system may be used to create a generic operating system image.

For more information, see [Importing and validating custom images into VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-importing-custom-images-vpc&interface=api).

Images that are used to create virtual server instances or to [create instance templates](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) must have a `user_data_format` value of `cloud_init`.

**Provisioning instances with IBM Cloud billed catalog offering plans.** You can now provision a virtual server instance with a [billed catalog offering](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-images-on-vpc-catalog&interface=ui#images-on-vpc-catalog-images) from the IBM Catalog. When [creating an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) specify the `catalog_offering.version.crn` or  `catalog_offering.offering.crn` property as before, and additionally specify the billing plan using the new `catalog_offering.plan.crn` property. You can still provision an instance without a plan, but if it's a billed plan, you must specify `catalog_offering.plan.crn`. The same requirements apply when provisioning an [instance template](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) for a billed offering. For more information, see [Provision an instance from a private catalog image by using the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=api#create-instance-private-catalog-image-api).

When [retrieving an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance) that was provisioned with a billed catalog offering, the new `catalog_offering.plan.crn` property provides the associated billing plan.

**Enhancements to volumes and shapshots in support of catalog offering plans.** When [retrieving a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-volume) that was originally provisioned as a boot volume from an instance with a [billed catalog offering](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-images-on-vpc-catalog&interface=ui#images-on-vpc-catalog-images), the response now includes both `catalog_offering.version.crn` and `catalog_offering.plan.crn` properties. The response includes the same properties when [retrieving a snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-snapshot) with a `source_volume` that had those properties.

**Virtual network interface protocol state filtering mode.** [Protocol state filtering](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about#protocol-state-filtering) monitors each network connection flowing over a virtual network interface (VNI), and drops any packets that are invalid based on the current connection state and protocol. Certain use cases, such as having a virtual server instance function as a network gateway, require selective disabling of this filtering. To accommodate these use cases, if you have the `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.manage-protocol-state-filtering-mode` IAM action, you can now set non-default values for the `protocol_state_filtering_mode` property when you are [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-virtual-network-interface) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-virtual-network-interface) a VNI.

The new `protocol_state_filtering_mode` property is supported for VNI methods and all methods in which a VNI can be created.

This release introduces the following updates for accounts that have been granted special approval to preview these features:

**Confidential computing capabilities.** On select instance profiles, you can now enable [Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc). When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) an instance, or when [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance-template) an instance template, you can specify the new `confidential_compute_mode` property (`disabled` or `sgx`) to use for a virtual server instance. The new `confidential_compute_modes` instance profile property indicates which profiles will support which modes. If you do not specify the `confidential_compute_mode` property when creating an instance or instance template, the default confidential compute mode from the profile will be used. For more information, see [Confidential computing with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) for Virtual Servers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc).

**Secure boot capabilities.** When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) an instance, or when [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-template) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance-template) an instance template, you can set the new `enable_secure_boot` property to `true` to enable secure boot on the virtual server instance. The new `secure_boot_modes` instance profile property indicates the secure boot modes supported by the profile. If you do not specify the `enable_secure_boot` property when creating an instance or instance template, the default secure boot mode from the profile will be used. To use secure boot, the image must support secure boot or the instance will fail to boot. For more information, see [Secure boot for Virtual Servers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-confidential-computing-with-secure-boot-vpc).

To update the `enable_secure_boot` and `confidential_compute_mode` properties, the virtual server instance `status` must be `stopping` or `stopped`.

**Snapshots `DELETE` response code change.** When [deleting a snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-snapshot) or [deleting a filtered collection of snapshots](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-snapshots) using a `version` query parameter of `2022-02-28` or later, the response will now return an HTTP response code of `202` upon success, instead of `204`. The underlying deletion operations were already asynchronous, and remain unchanged.

To avoid regressions in client functionality, before issuing requests using a `version` query parameter of `2022-02-28` or later, ensure that any clients deleting snapshot resources will also regard a response code of `202` as success.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-security-group-rule) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-security-group-rule) a security group rule, specify the optional `local` property. The value can be an IP address or a range of IP addresses in CIDR format. If not specified, the default value is `cidr_block: 0.0.0.0/0`, which means the rule allows traffic to all local IP addresses (or from all local IP addresses, for outbound rules). This default value will be applied to all existing security group rules.

You can also now fully control the local and peer IKE identities assigned to a VPN gateway connection by using properties `local.ike_identities` and `peer.ike_identity`. If unspecified, the local IKE identities will default to the public IP addresses of the VPN gateway and member's VPN connection tunnel. The peer identity will default to either the peer's address or FQDN, depending on what was specified.

For migration guidance, see [Updating to the `2024-04-30` version (VPN gateway connection)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2024-04-30-migration-vpn-advanced-configuration). See also the [known issue](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-limitations#known-issues-vpn-gateway) about updating the `peer.address` or `peer.fqdn` of a VPN connection tunnel.

**Migration of VPN gateway connection CIDR paths.** Using a `version` query parameter of `2024-04-30` or later, API paths for [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-gateway-connections-local-cidrs), [removing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#remove-vpn-gateway-connections-local-cidr), [checking](/apidocs/vpc/latest#check-vpn-gateway-connections-local-cidr), or [setting](/apidocs/vpc/latest#add-vpn-gateway-connections-local-cidr) a local CIDR, and [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-gateway-connections-peer-cidrs), [removing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#remove-vpn-gateway-connections-peer-cidr), [checking](/apidocs/vpc/latest#check-vpn-gateway-connections-peer-cidr), or [setting](/apidocs/vpc/latest#add-vpn-gateway-connections-peer-cidr) a peer CIDR are changed. See [Updating to the `2024-04-30` version (VPN gateway connection)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2024-04-30-migration-vpn-advanced-configuration) for guidance on migration.

**VPN gateway connection schema change.**  As of version `2023-04-30`, the VPN gateway connection `peer_address`, `peer_cidrs`, and `local_cidrs` properties have been replaced by new `peer` and `local` properties. These changes apply to all methods that interact with VPN gateway connections, including [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpn-gateway-connection), [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpn-gateway-connection), or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpn-gateway-connection) a VPN gateway connection.

**Reservations for Virtual Servers for VPC.** You can now purchase a [capacity reservation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc&interface=ui) for a specified instance profile in a specified zone. Reservations provide resources for future deployments and cost savings over the life of the term within the availability zone of your choice.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-reservation) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-reservation) a reservation, specify the `capacity.total` and `committed_use.term` properties to use for this reservation. Optionally specify the `committed_use.expiration_policy` property to apply when the committed use term expires (default: `release`). Specify the `profile.name` and `profile.resource_type` properties of the profile, and the `zone` property to use for this reservation. After you confirm the reservation is configured the way you want it, you must [activate the reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#activate-reservation). The reservation cannot be deleted until the committed use term expires. To provision an instance using a reservation's capacity, specify the reservation using the `reservation_affinity.pool` property when [creating the instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance). You can also [update an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) that's been provisioned to associate it with a reservation.

When [retrieving an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance), the new `reservation_affinity` property indicates the reservation affinity policy in effect for the virtual server instance. The new `health_state` property indicates the instance's overall health state, while an accompanying `health_reasons` property indicates the reason for any unhealthy health states, such as a failed reservation.

For more information, see [Provisioning reserved capacity for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-provisioning-reserved-capacity-vpc&interface=api).

**Local IP addresses in security group rules.** Accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature can now specify local IP addresses or address ranges in security group rules. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc#create-security-group-rule) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc#update-security-group-rule) a security group rule, specify the optional `local` property. The value can be an IP address or a range of IP addresses in CIDR format, where `0.0.0.0/0` means the rule allows traffic to all local IP addresses (or from all local IP addresses, for an outbound rule). The default value is `cidr_block: 0.0.0.0/0`, which is also used for all existing rules.

**Sharing DNS resolution for endpoint gateways across VPCs.** When multiple VPCs are connected together using Transit Gateway, Direct Link, or other connectivity options, a VPC in the connected topology can now be enabled as a DNS hub to centralize the DNS resolution for endpoint gateways. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc) a VPC, the `dns` property includes new configuration options for DNS. Specify the `dns.enable_hub` property as `true` to enable the VPC as a DNS hub (default is `false`). Specify a DNS hub VPC when [creating a DNS resolution binding](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-dns-resolution-binding) on another VPC to share its DNS resolution with that DNS hub VPC. The `dns.resolution_binding_count` response property specifies how many other VPCs a VPC is bound to for DNS resolution sharing. For more information, see [About DNS sharing for VPE gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing).

**Configuring DNS resolvers for a VPC.** You can now use the `dns.resolver` property to configure the DNS resolvers for a VPC. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `manual` to specify the DNS resolvers by IP address. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `delegated` to specify another VPC (typically a DNS hub VPC) whose DNS resolvers will be used. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `system` to restore the system default DNS resolvers. When `dns.resolver.type` is `manual`, [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc) specifying the VPC's `dns.resolver.manual_servers` requires the [`If-Match` header](/apidocs/vpc/latest#concurrent-update-protection) also be provided with the VPC's current `ETag` value.

**Virtual network interfaces.** Accounts that have not requested a feature deferral through [IBM Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter) can use a new feature that expands the support for [virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about).

Your account is affected by these changes if you have API clients (such as custom automations, auditing scripts, or dashboards) that interact with instances, bare metal servers, network interfaces, or file shares. For more information about what changed, along with guidance on avoiding possible failures due to these changes, see [Mitigating behavior changes to virtual network interfaces, instances, bare metal servers, and file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-api-introduction).
{: important}

- You can now create [instances](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) and [bare metal servers](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server) with virtual network interfaces attached to new child resources called network attachments. You can specify a `primary_network_attachment` (instead of a `primary_network_interface`) and provide either the identity of an already created virtual network interface, or a subnet to create a new virtual network interface for the instance or bare metal server.
- Virtual network interfaces now have lifecycles that are independent of the resources they are attached to. You can [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-virtual-network-interface) the `auto_delete` property to `false` to allow a virtual network interface to persist beyond the lifecycle of its original bare metal server or instance, and be re-attached to another bare metal server or instance.
- Virtual network interfaces now support [secondary IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about-secondary-ip). You can now [add](/apidocs/vpc/latest#add-virtual-network-interface-ip) and [remove](/apidocs/vpc/latest#remove-virtual-network-interface-ip) reserved IPs to and from a virtual network interface.
- For compatibility with existing clients, instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces now include a read-only representation of their network attachments and virtual network interfaces as old-style network interface child resources. Learn about [support for old API clients](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about&interface=ui#vni-old-api-clients).
- For instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces, the IAM permissions for options to allow IP spoofing or disable infrastructure NAT are now managed on their attached virtual network interfaces. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-virtual-network-interface) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-virtual-network-interface) a virtual network interface, you can set non-default values for the `allow_ip_spoofing` and `enable_infrastructure_nat` properties only if you have the `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.manage-ip-spoofing` and `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.manage-infrastructure-nat` IAM permissions respectively.
- You can now use [flow log collectors](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-flow-log-collector) to target instance network attachments and virtual network interfaces. There is no support for flow logs for bare metal servers and share mount targets.

**Resource suspension for instance groups.** The [list all instance groups](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-groups) and [retrieve an instance group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-group) methods now include `lifecycle_reasons` and `lifecycle_state` properties. An instance group that violates the IBM Cloud [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.ibm.com/services/us/imc/html/aup1.html){: external} will have its `lifecycle_state` property set to `suspended`. A suspended instance group will not auto scale or self heal, and you cannot enable, update, or delete it.

**Reservations for Virtual Servers for VPC.** Accounts that have been granted special approval to preview this feature can now purchase a [capacity reservation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-reserved-virtual-servers-vpc) for a specified instance profile in a specified zone. Reservations provide resources for future deployments and cost savings over the life of the term within the availability zone of your choice.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-reservation) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-reservation) a reservation, specify the `capacity.total` and `committed_use.term` properties to use for this reservation. Optionally specify the `committed_use.expiration_policy` property to apply when the committed use term expires (default: `release`). Specify the `profile.name` and `profile.resource_type` properties of the profile, and the `zone` property to use for this reservation. After you confirm the reservation is configured the way you want it, you must [activate the reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#activate-reservation). The reservation cannot be deleted until the committed use term expires. To provision an instance using a reservation's capacity, specify the reservation using the `reservation_affinity.pool` property when [creating the instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance). You can also [update an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) that's been provisioned to associate it with a reservation.

When [retrieving an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance), the new `reservation_affinity` property indicates the reservation affinity policy in effect for the virtual server instance. The new `health_state` property indicates the instance's overall health state, while an accompanying `health_reasons` property indicates the reason for any unhealthy health states, such as a failed reservation.

For more information, see [Provisioning reserved capacity for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-provisioning-reserved-capacity-vpc).

This feature is now generally available. See the [26 March 2024](#26-march-2024) announcement.

**VPC route advertisement to Direct Link and Transit Gateway.** When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table-route) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table-route) a route in a routing table, you can set the new `advertise` property to `true` (default is `false`). For the route to be advertised, the route's routing table must be configured for the source or sources to advertise it to:

- When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table) a VPC routing table, you can set the new `advertise_routes_to` array property to include the value `direct_link`. Including this value requires that the routing table's `route_direct_link_ingress` property be set to `true`. Routes in this routing table with the `advertise` property set to `true` will be advertised to Direct Link sources.
- When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table) a VPC routing table, you can set the new `advertise_routes_to` array property to include the value `transit_gateway`. Including this value requires that the routing table's `route_transit_gateway_ingress` property be set to `true`. Routes in this routing table with the `advertise` property set to `true` will be advertised to Transit Gateway sources.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table) a routing table, the default value for the `advertise_routes_to` property is an empty array. When the `advertise_routes_to` property is an empty array, the `advertise` property for routes in the table has no effect.

**Virtual network interface expanded support.** Accounts that have been granted special approval can preview a new feature that expands the support for [virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about):

- [Instances](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) and [bare metal servers](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server) can now be created with virtual network interfaces attached to new child resources called network attachments. You can specify a `primary_network_attachment` (instead of a `primary_network_interface`) and provide either the identity of an existing virtual network interface, or a subnet to create a new virtual network interface for the instance or bare metal server.
- Virtual network interfaces can now have lifecycles that are independent of the resources they are attached to. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-virtual-network-interface) a virtual network interface, the `auto_delete` property is set to `false`. When automatically creating a new virtual network interface in the context of creating another resource, the `auto_delete` property for the automatically created virtual network interface defaults to `true`. You can override it, or you can later [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-virtual-network-interface) the `auto_delete` property to `false`. A virtual network interface with `auto_delete` set to `false` persists beyond the lifecycle of its current `target` resource. After the target resource is deleted, you can re-attach the virtual network interface to another resource, such as to a bare metal server, an instance, or a share mount target.
- Virtual network interfaces now support [secondary IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about-secondary-ip). To add a secondary IP, [bind](/apidocs/vpc/latest#add-virtual-network-interface-ip) a reserved IP to a virtual network interface. To remove a secondary IP, [unbind](/apidocs/vpc/latest#remove-virtual-network-interface-ip) a reserved IP from from a virtual network interface.
- For compatibility with existing clients, instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces now include a read-only representation of their network attachments and virtual network interfaces as legacy network interface child resources. Learn about [support for old API clients](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about&interface=ui#vni-old-api-clients).
- For instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces, the IAM permissions for options to allow IP spoofing or disable infrastructure NAT are managed on their attached virtual network interfaces. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-virtual-network-interface) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-virtual-network-interface) a virtual network interface, you can set non-default values for the `allow_ip_spoofing` and `enable_infrastructure_nat` properties only if you have the `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.manage-ip-spoofing` and `is.virtual-network-interface.virtual-network-interface.manage-infrastructure-nat` IAM permissions respectively.
- [Flow log collectors](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-flow-log-collector) can now target instance network attachments and virtual network interfaces. There is currently no support for flow logs for bare metal servers and share mount targets.

**Cross-region replication of file shares.** When [creating a file share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-share), you can now specify a zone in an associated partner region to create a replica file share. For more information about cross-region pairings, see [About file share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication). A [service-to-service authorization for cross-region replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-s2s-auth&interface=api#file-s2s-auth-replication-api) between the regional file services must be created before creating a replica.

An important difference between setting up in-region and cross-region replication is configuring the encryption for the replica share.

- When the replica is created in another zone of the same region, the encryption type and the encryption key are inherited from the source share and can't be changed.
- When the replica is created in another region, only the encryption type is inherited. Therefore, if the source share has `user_managed` encryption, you must specify the root key by using the `encryption_key` property when creating the replica share.
{: note}

When [retrieving a file share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-share), the `source_share` property now includes a `remote` sub-property that, if present in the response, indicates that the resource that is associated with this reference is remote and might not be directly retrievable.

**Last replication sync information.** When [retrieving a file share](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-share), the response now includes the properties `completed_at`, `started_at`, and `data_transferred`. These properties provide information about the replication process that can be used to monitor the health of the replication. For more information, see [Replication sync information](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=api#fs-repl-syncinfo).

**Multi-volume snapshots and backups.** This release introduces a new way to create snapshots. You can now [create a snapshot consistency group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot-consistency-group) and specify one or more snapshots that are attached to the same virtual server instance. When you create a consistency group, you are implicitly creating one or more snapshots. Snapshots taken simultaneously are data-consistent with one another, which helps to ensure consistent backups of a group of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes attached to the same instance. [Deleting a snapshot consistency group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-snapshot-consistency-group) will delete the snapshots in the group by default. However, you can keep the snapshots and delete the consistency group by specifying the `delete_snapshots_on_delete` property.

You can also automate the creation of snapshots in consistency groups. When [creating a backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy) you can now specify `instance` as a `match_resource_type` value that this backup policy will apply to. Resources that have both a matching type and a matching user tag will be subject to the backup policy. You can exclude boot volumes from backup policies by specifying the `included_content` property. The default behavior includes boot volumes and data volumes.

For more information, see [Backup service concepts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about&interface=api#backup-service-concepts), [Snapshot consistency groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=api#multi-volume-snapshots), and explore the [backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-backup-policies) and [snapshot consistency group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-snapshot-consistency-groups) methods.

When making API requests using a `version` query parameter of `2023-12-05` or later, the backup policy `match_resource_types` property has been changed to `match_resource_type`. This change applies when [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy), [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-backup-policy), [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-backup-policies), [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-backup-policy), and [deleting](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-backup-policy) a backup policy. See [Updating to the `2023-12-05` version (backup policies)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2023-12-05-migration-backup-policy) for guidance on migrating from `match_resource_types` to `match_resource_type`.

**Network load balancer security group integration.** For enhanced security, you can now associate security groups with [network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-integration-with-security-groups). When [creating a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer), you can now specify the `security_groups` property, which associates those security groups with the load balancer. If you do not specify `security_groups`, the network load balancer will be associated with the VPC's default security group. Before using the default security group, review your default security group rules and, if necessary, edit the rules to accommodate your expected network load balancer traffic.

All existing network load balancers in your account will continue to allow all inbound and outbound traffic. This is indicated by the `security_groups` property being set to an empty array (no security groups configured).
{: note}

When creating a network load balancer, you must now have an appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with the `is.security-group.security-group.operate` action.
{: note}

You can update security groups for a network load balancer by [adding a network load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-security-group-target-binding) to or [removing a network load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-security-group-target-binding) from a security group's targets.

You will not be able to remove the only remaining security group from a network load balancer. As a result, if you add a security group to a network load balancer that had no security groups, you will not be able to revert that network load balancer to have no security groups.

Finally, the security group `targets` property can now refer to a network load balancer, as can the responses for the [get security group target](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-security-group-target) and [list security group targets](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-security-group-targets) methods.

**Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) awareness on instances and dedicated hosts.**  When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instances) instances, the new `numa_count` property indicates the number of NUMA nodes on which a virtual server instance is provisioned. This property will be absent from the response if the instance's `status` is not `running`. When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-dedicated-host) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-dedicated-hosts) dedicated hosts, the new `numa.count` and `numa.nodes` properties describe the processor topology.

When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles, the `numa_count` property indicates the total number of NUMA nodes for an instance with this profile. When the `type` is `dependent`, the total number of NUMA nodes for an instance with this profile depends on its configuration and the capacity constraints within the zone. Not all instance profiles have a strict NUMA definition within them.

For more information, see [Next generation instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=api#next-gen-profiles).

**Status on instance profiles and dedicated host profiles.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) instance profiles or [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-dedicated-host-profile) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-dedicated-host-profiles) dedicated host profiles, a new `status` property indicates the status of the instance profile or dedicated host profile. A `status` value of `previous` indicates an older profile generation that remains provisionable and usable. A `status` value of `current` indicates the latest generation of a given profile. For more information, see [Next generation instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=api#next-gen-profiles) and [Dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-dh-profiles).

**Viewing DNS resolver information for VPCs.** When [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpc) a VPC, the new `dns.resolver` property contains information about the DNS resolvers provided by the system for DHCP clients in the VPC.

This release introduces the following updates for accounts that have been granted special approval to preview these features:

- **Sharing DNS resolution for endpoint gateways across VPCs.** When multiple VPCs are connected together using Transit Gateway, Direct Link, or other connectivity options, a VPC in the connected topology can now be enabled as a DNS hub to centralize the DNS resolution for endpoint gateways. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc) a VPC, a new `dns` property includes configuration options for DNS. Specify the `dns.enable_hub` property as `true` to enable the VPC as a DNS hub (default is `false`).  Specify a DNS hub VPC when [creating a DNS resolution binding](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-dns-resolution-binding) on another VPC to share its DNS resolution with that DNS hub VPC. The new `dns.resolution_binding_count` response property specifies how many other VPCs a VPC is bound to for DNS resolution sharing. For more information, see [About DNS sharing for VPE gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-dns-sharing).

- **Configuring DNS resolvers for a VPC.** You can use the new `dns.resolver` property to configure the DNS resolvers for a VPC. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `manual` to specify the DNS resolvers by IP address. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `delegated` to specify another VPC (typically a DNS hub VPC) whose DNS resolvers will be used. Use a `dns.resolver.type` of `system` to restore the system default DNS resolvers. When `dns.resolver.type` is `manual`, [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc) specifying the VPC's `dns.resolver.manual_servers` requires the [`If-Match` header](/apidocs/vpc/latest#concurrent-update-protection) also be provided with the VPC's current `ETag` value.

**Copying snapshots and backups across regions.** You can now specify an existing snapshot in one region to [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot) a copy of the snapshot in another region. When you [list all snapshots](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-snapshots), you can see the direct snapshot copies in the other regions and you can use them to restore volumes in the other regions. You can create copies in multiple regions, but only one copy of the snapshot can exist in each region. The cross-region snapshot copy contains the same data as the source snapshot, but the cross-region snapshot copy has its own, independent lifecycle and is billed independently. For more information, see [Cross-regional snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about#snapshots_vpc_crossregion_copy) and [Cross-regional copy array issue](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=ui#snapshots_vpc_crossregion_copy).

You can now [create a backup policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy) that creates backup copies in other regions, in addition to creating a backup snapshot in the current region. [Retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-backup-policy-plan) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-backup-policy-plans) backup policy plans shows the `copies` of the snapshot in other regions. For more information, see [Cross-regional backup copies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about&interface=api#backup-service-crc).

**Extended SSH key encryption.** When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-key) an SSH key, you can now specify a `type` property value of `ed25519` for the crypto-system used by the key.

**Instance group integration with Network Load Balancer for VPC.** Network load balancer is now integrated with instance groups to improve pool member scaling. When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-group) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance-group) an instance group for auto scaling, you can now also specify a network load balancer pool for the `load_balancer_pool` property. As before, if `load_balancer_pool` is set, `load_balancer` and `application_port` must also be set. As with application load balancers, the pool must not be used by another instance group in the VPC. When you configure a listener with a range of ports, the instance group's application port is used only for checking the health status of targets. For more information see [Creating an instance group for auto scaling](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group).

In the future, load balancer profiles may be introduced that do not support instance groups. To ensure your clients will work reliably in the future, check that the new `instance_groups_supported` property on the [load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) is `true` before specifying that load balancer or one of its pools.

**Instance provision by volume.**  You can now reuse an existing boot volume to provision a virtual server instance by specifying the existing volume using the `id` or `crn` sub-properties of the `boot_volume_attachment` property. The specified volume must be unattached and must have an operating system with the same architecture as the instance profile. You can use the new volume `attachment_state` property and expanded `operating_system` property to determine its eligibility. You can also use the new [list volumes](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-volumes) filters to list volumes that have specific `attachment_state`, `operating_system`, and `encryption_type` values.

By default, a boot volume created as part of provisioning a virtual server instance will be deleted when the instance is deleted. You can control this by specifying the `delete_volume_on_instance_delete` property when [creating the instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or updating the [boot volume attachment](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance-volume-attachment). For more information, see [Creating virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=api).

**VPC route priority.** You can now control the priority of [VPC routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-custom-routes). When you [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table-route) or [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table-route) a VPC route, use the new `priority` property to specify a value between `0` and `4` (default: `2`). Smaller values have higher priority. For more information, see [Determining route preference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-custom-routes#cr-determining-route-pref).

**Modifiable next hop for VPC routes.** You can now [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table-route) the `next_hop` property of a VPC route. For more information about next hop, see [Creating a route](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-vpc-route).

**VPC instance metadata communication protocol and hop limit.** You can now control the communication protocol and hop limit for IP response packets used by the [VPC Instance Metadata service](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-imd-about). When you [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) an instance, use the new `metadata_service.protocol` property to specify either `http` (default) or `https` (secure access) communication. In addition, use the new `metadata_service.response_hop_limit` property to specify a value between `1` (default) and `64`. Both of these properties apply only when the metadata service is enabled by setting `metadata_service.enabled` to `true`. The default is `false`.

You can create a fast restore clone when you [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot) a new snapshot or [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot-clone) an existing snapshot by adding one or more zonal clones for a snapshot in the same region as the snapshot. Later, you can restore a volume, and all of its data, from that fast restore snapshot clone. When you no longer need a zonal snapshot clone, you can [delete](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-snapshot-clone) it. Although the delete operation cannot be reversed, you can create an new, equivalent zonal clone from the snapshot.

When [creating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy-plan) or [updating](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-backup-policy-plan) a backup policy plan, you can now specify the `clone_policy.zones` in which backup service will create snapshot clones.

- [Delete a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-bare-metal-server)

Unlike previous response code changes, the transition from `204` to `202` applies to all API versions.  Therefore, a response code of `204` will not be returned for any API requests for these methods, regardless of the `version` query parameter value.

**Sharing images across accounts within an enterprise.** You can now use a [catalog to share custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=api) with users in other accounts within the same enterprise. When you [create an image](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-image), a new `catalog_offering` property includes a `managed` sub-property that is set to `false` by default.  When the custom image is imported to a catalog the `managed` sub-property is set to `true`, indicating that the image is added to a catalog offering `version` and is managed from a catalog. Any user who has been authorized to the catalog offering version can [provision a virtual server instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) with that image by specifying the offering version's CRN as `catalog_offering.version.crn`. Alternatively, users can specify the offering's CRN as `catalog_offering.offering.crn` to provision a virtual server instance with the latest image associated with the catalog offering. For more information, see [Custom images in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-private-catalog-image-instance-group&interface=ui), the tutorial [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial&interface=ui), and the [Import offering](/apidocs/resource-catalog/private-catalog#import-offering){: external} method in the Catalog Management API.

The image may not be deleted or used in a different catalog product offering version while it is managed from a catalog. If the catalog is deleted, a 7 day reclamation period will apply that prevents any images managed by the catalog from being deleted or re-used during the reclamation period. For more information, see [Deleting a custom image in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=ui#deleting-private-catalog-custom-image-vpc) and [Using resource reclamations](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation&interface=api).

Image references may refer to custom images in other accounts. Before using this feature, verify that your clients handle image reference lookup failures gracefully and do not assume inaccessible images have been deleted, even when running with full access to your images.  To avoid possible retrieval or use of the wrong image by `name`, specify the image `id`, `crn`, or `href` instead. For more information, see [Using cross-account image references in a private catalog in the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=api#private-catalog-image-reference-vpc-api).

**Increased network interface limits for virtual server instances.** You can now have up to 14 secondary network interfaces on a virtual server instance. The previous limit for secondary network interfaces was 4. The number of interfaces that a virtual server instance supports is dependent on the VCPU count that is included in the [instance profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles). For more information about the number of interfaces that a virtual server supports, see [Bandwidth allocation with multiple network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui#bandwidth-multi-vnic). To utilize the increased limit for network interfaces, you can create secondary network interfaces by specifying `network_interfaces` when you [create an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance). You also can add secondary network interfaces to an existing instance by [creating a network interface on an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-network-interface).

For an existing, running instance with 17 or more vCPUs to take advantage of the new network interface limits, it must be stopped and then started again. A reboot action on the running virtual server does not activate the increased network interface limit.

**IBM&reg; LinuxONE Bare Metal Servers.** Accounts with access to the profiles for s390x bare metal servers can now [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server) LinuxONE Bare Metal Servers. These profiles have a `cpu_architecture` of `s390x` and must be used with Red Hat Enterprise Linux for s390x and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for s390x. For more information, see [Creating bare metal servers on VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-bare-metal-servers&interface=api).

In support of s390x bare metal servers, the following enumerations have been expanded:

- Because s390x local disks are attached through Fiber Channel protocol, a value of `fcp` has been added to the `interface_type` enumeration that is returned when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-bare-metal-server-disk) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-server-disks) the disks for a bare metal server.

- Because s390x provides TCP/IP connectivity by using HiperSockets, a value of `hipersocket` has been added to the `interface_type` enumeration returned when [retrieving](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-bare-metal-server-network-interface) or [listing](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-server-network-interfaces) the network interfaces on an s390x bare metal server. Similarly, when you [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server) an s390x bare metal server, or [add](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server-network-interface) a network interface to an existing s390x bare metal server, you must specify an `interface_type` of `hipersocket`. For more information, see the [_IBM HiperSockets Implementation Guide_](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246816.html){: external}.

s390x bare metal servers have different network bandwidth and maximum network interface limits from x86 bare metal servers.

**Deprecated VPN for VPC ciphers.** The following VPN IKE and IPsec ciphers are now deprecated:

- Authentication algorithms `md5` and `sha1`
- Encryption algorithm `triple_des`
- Diffie–Hellman groups `2` and `5`

You have until 13 December 2022 to upgrade to more secure ciphers. After this date, VPN connections using deprecated ciphers will have a `status` of `down` (and no longer transfer data) until you upgrade from the weak cipher.

**Additional VPN for VPC ciphers.** VPN gateways now provide new algorithms to help meet your security and compliance requirements.

[IKE policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-ike-policies) methods now support the `sha384` value for the `authentication_algorithm` property, `aes192` value for the `encryption_algorithm` property, and groups 15-18, 20-24, and 31 for the `dh_group` property.

[IPsec policy](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-ipsec-policies) methods now support `sha384` and `disabled` values for the `authentication_algorithm` property, `aes192`, `aes128gcm16`, `aes192gcm16`, and `aes256gcm16` values for the `encryption_algorithm` property, and groups 15-18, 20-24, and 31 for the `dh_group` property.

Specifying IKE and IPsec policies when configuring a VPN connection is optional. If a policy is not specified, one is chosen through _auto-negotiation_. For more information, see [About policy negotiation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn#policy-negotiation).

**Updating subnets for application load balancers.** You can now update the subnets attached to an application load balancer by specifying `subnets` when [updating a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-load-balancer). The specified subnets must be in the same VPC as the load balancer's current subnets. If the update requires moving your load balancer to a different zone, its `provisioning_status` will change to `migrate_pending` until the move is complete. For more information, see [Updating subnets for Application Load Balancers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-alb-updating-subnets&interface=api).

Verify that any clients retrieving the `provisioning_status` property will gracefully handle unknown values. For example, a client might bypass the load balancer, log a message, or halt processing and surface an error.

Because the `subnets` property is an array, the specified value will replace the load balancer's existing array of subnets. To guard against concurrent updates, you must provide the resource's current ETag using the `If-Match` header. For guidance on the use of ETags, see [Concurrent update protection](/apidocs/vpc/latest#concurrent-update-protection).

- [Delete a load balancer pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-load-balancer-pool)
- [Delete a load balancer pool member](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-load-balancer-pool-member)

The underlying deletion operations were already asynchronous, and remain unchanged.

To avoid regressions, before issuing requests using a `version` query parameter of `2022-09-13` or later, ensure that any clients deleting load balancer resources will also regard a response code of `202` as success.

**Client VPN for VPC.** Client-to-site connectivity is now available. This feature allows remote devices to securely connect to a VPC using an OpenVPN (or other compatible) software client. For more information about VPN client-to-site connectivity and how it complements the existing VPN site-to-site connectivity, see [About client-to-site VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview).

- A **VPN server** allows VPN clients from the internet to connect to a VPC. When [creating a VPN server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpn-server), you can specify a security group to protect the VPN server, and subnets in your VPC in which the VPN server will allocate its [reserved IP addresses](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-subnet-reserved-ips). For more information, see [Creating a VPN server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-server) and the new [VPN server methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-servers).
- A **VPN client** represents a client connecting from the internet. You can [retrieve the OpenVPN client configuration](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpn-server-client-configuration) to use to configure a VPN client for a VPN server. For more information, see [Setting up a client VPN environment and connecting to a VPN server](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-environment-setup) and the new [VPN client methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-server-clients).
- A **VPN route** controls which subnets the VPN client can access and how the traffic from the VPN client reaches these subnets. For more information, see [Managing VPN routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-routes) and the new [VPN server route methods](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpn-server-routes).

**Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways and VPN servers.** When you [create a VPC routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table), you can now control if the routing table accepts routes from a VPN gateway or server by specifying the `accept_routes_from` property. When you [view a route in a VPC routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-vpc-routing-table-route), the new `origin` property shows who created the route (either `user` or `service`), and the `service` routes include a new `creator` property that references the resource that created the route. Routes with the `creator` property present cannot be deleted directly. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-advertise-routes-s2s&interface=ui) and [VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation).

**Concurrent update protection.** ETags returned on `GET`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests represent the modifiable state of the resource. When updating the `accept_routes_from` property on a [routing table](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpc-routing-table), or updating the `client_authentication`, `client_dns_servers`, or `subnets` properties on a [VPN server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-vpn-server), you must provide the resource's ETag using the `If-Match` header.

**Block storage.** You can now create a volume from a snapshot without having to also create and attach it to a virtual server instance. When you [create a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume), a new `source_snapshot` property lets you specify a snapshot which will be used as source data for the new volume. The volume's data is fully restored later, when you attach it to an instance. Volume performance is initially degraded until the volume data is fully restored. For more information, see [Restoring an unattached data volume from a snapshot with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore&interface=api#snapshots-vpc-restore-unattached-api).

**Cross-zone member support for network load balancers.** You can now [create a load balancer pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool) with members across any zone in the region. You can also use the [create pool member](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool-member) or [replace pool member](/apidocs/vpc/latest#replace-load-balancer-pool-members) methods to update an existing pool with members across any zone in the region. The zone of the network load balancer is still identified by the subnet that you specify when you create a load balancer.

Network load balancers with `route_mode` enabled do not support cross zone members.

**Backup for VPC.** You can now create backup policies to schedule automatic backups of your block storage volumes. Backups are made when a user tag in a block storage volume matches a user tag defined in a backup policy. Backups are created by a schedule defined in a [backup plan](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-backup-policy-plan). Each plan also has a deletion policy for managing backups created by the plan, which you can customize by specifying the `deletion_trigger` sub-property. At the scheduled interval, a backup snapshot is created of that volume. You can have up to four backup plans per policy. See [Backup for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about).

The backup policy jobs API remains in [beta](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log-beta#24-may-2022-beta).

**Reserved IPs for compute.** Using a `version` query parameter of `2022-03-29` or later, you can now fully control the IP addresses assigned to your network interfaces by specifying a new or existing reserved IP when you [create an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) or [create a bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-bare-metal-server).

**Migration of network interface IP addresses.** In support of reserved IPs, for requests using a `version` query parameter of `2022-03-29` or later, the network interface `primary_ipv4_address` string property has been migrated to the `primary_ip` object property. See [Migrating use of IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2022-03-29-migration#migrate-ip-addresses) for guidance on how to migrate to `primary_ip`.

**Removal of security group network interfaces.** The methods for associating security groups with network interfaces that were deprecated in [API version `2021-02-23`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#23-february-2021) have been removed as of version `2022-03-29`. See [Migrating use of security group associations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-2022-03-29-migration#migrate-security-group-assoc) for guidance on how to migrate to use security group targets, which allow security groups to be associated with VPC resources beyond network interfaces, such as endpoint gateways and load balancers.

**Reserved IP management.** You can explicitly [Reserve an IP in a subnet](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-subnet-reserved-ip) ahead of time, and [List all reserved IPs on a subnet](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-subnet-reserved-ips) to see all your VPC resources that are using IP addresses on that subnet, including load balancers and VPN gateways. For more information, see [Managing IP addresses](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-ip-addresses).

**UDP support for network load balancers.** When [creating a network load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer) (NLB), you can now set User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the communications protocol for NLB listeners and pools by specifying `udp` for the `protocol` sub-property of the [`listener`](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener) and [`pool`](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool) properties respectively. (Health checks do not support UDP for monitoring the health of pool members.) For more information, see [Configuring UDP for network load balancers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-udp&interface=api).

You must set the same protocol for the load balancer pool and listeners using that pool.
{: tip}

Not all network load balancer offerings will support UDP. Before creating a UDP network load balancer (or updating an existing NLB listener to use UDP), check that the `udp_supported` property of the [load balancer profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-profiles) is `true`.

The `host_failure` sub-property can be used to set the host failure `availability_policy` of the virtual server instance. The default policy is `restart`, which relocates the instance to a healthy host and restarts the instance. The policy may be set to `stop` to have the instance remain stopped if the compute host experiences a failure.

**Port ranges for public network load balancers.** When [creating a public network load balancer](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-ui-creating-network-load-balancer&interface=api) you can now specify a range of listener ports. When you configure a load balancer with a port range, the `port` property of the load balancer's [pool members](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancer-pool-members) will not be used for port translation on incoming traffic. Instead, traffic will arrive at the member on the same port it arrived on at the listener.

Before using this feature on a load balancer, update client applications that integrate with it to check the `port_min` and `port_max` properties on the [load balancer listener](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer-listener). If those properties do not have the same value, the client must consider the inclusive range between `port_min` and `port_max` as the possible ports on which traffic can arrive at the member. However, if `port_min` and `port_max` have the same value, the behavior will be unchanged and traffic will arrive on the port specified by the `port` property of the load balancer pool member.

You can set up VMware management applications and create VMware virtual machines on the bare metal servers. The new [bare metal server](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-servers) APIs use a similar structure and employ the same concepts as the existing [instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instances) APIs. There is also a parallel but separate set of [bare metal server profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-bare-metal-server-profiles) APIs with similar conventions to the existing [instance profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles) APIs.

**Security groups for endpoint gateways.** For enhanced security, you can now associate security groups with [endpoint gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe). When you [create an endpoint gateway](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-endpoint-gateway), you can now specify the `security_groups` property, which associates those security groups with the endpoint gateway. If you do not specify `security_groups`, the endpoint gateway will be associated with the VPC's default security group. Before using the default security group, review your default security group rules and, if necessary, edit the rules to accommodate your endpoint gateway traffic.

Responses that return an endpoint gateway now include the `security_groups` property. On endpoint gateways created before 25 January 2022, the `security_groups` property in the response is an empty array (`[]`), and no security groups are set.

You can update security groups for an endpoint gateway by [adding an endpoint gateway](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-security-group-target-binding) to or [removing an endpoint gateway](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-security-group-target-binding) from a security group's targets.

You will not be able to remove the only remaining security group from an endpoint gateway. As a result, if you add a security group to an endpoint gateway which had no security groups, you will not be able to revert the endpoint gateway to have no security groups.

Finally, the security group `targets` property can now refer to an endpoint gateway, as can the responses for the [get security group target](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-security-group-target) and [list security group target](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-security-group-targets) methods.

**Snapshots for VPC.** A `captured_at` property has been added to each [snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-snapshots), indicating the date and time when the snapshot was captured from the volume. The `captured_at` timestamp value is a close approximation to the actual snapshot time, typically within a few seconds. The actual snapshot capture is between the `created_at` and `captured_at` timestamps. (The `created_at` property indicates when the [snapshot creation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot) process was initiated.)

If `captured_at` is absent from the response, the snapshot's data has not yet been captured. Additionally, the property may be absent for snapshots created before 1 January 2022.

**Route mode for VNF support for network load balancers.** [Network load balancers](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer) now support a new "route mode" enabling virtual network functions (VNFs) as back-end targets. A `route_mode` property has been added to the load balancer resource to indicate if the load balancer is in route mode. A `route_mode_supported` property has been added to the load balancer profile resource to indicate if the profile supports route mode. Presently, only network load balancer profiles support route mode.

The [Create load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer) and [Create load balancer listener](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener) methods now accept properties `port_min` and `port_max`. You can request a load balancer listener for a single port by setting either the `port` property, or by setting the `port_min` and `port_max` properties to the same value. All load balancer listener responses now include `port_min` and `port_max` properties, with `port_min` matching the value of the existing `port` property.

When creating load balancers with route mode enabled, you must specify the listener's `port_min` value as `1`,  the `port_max` value as `65535`, and omit the `port` property. Other port range values are not currently supported, as noted in [Known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues).

**Instance bandwidth.** New properties have been added to the [create](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance) and [update](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance) instance methods to allow adjustment to the amount of total bandwidth (in megabits per second) allocated exclusively to attached volumes. The range of acceptable volume bandwidth values depends on the selected instance profile. A new `total_volume_bandwidth` property, added to each [instance profile](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-profiles), provides the range of possible values, and the default value used when creating an instance. An increase in `total_volume_bandwidth` will result in a corresponding decrease to `total_network_bandwidth`.

The volume bandwidth allocated to your existing instances will be unaffected unless:

- The instance's `total_volume_bandwidth` is lowered
- The total bandwidth requested by the instance's attached volumes exceeds the amount already requested by its attached volumes

**Block storage volumes:**

- **Adjustable IOPS.** To manage the performance the your data volumes attached to running virtual server instances, use the [update volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-volume) method to specify a different tiered `profile` value, or a different `iops` value within the [custom IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#custom) tier. For more information, see [Adjusting IOPS for block storage volumes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops&interface=api).

- **Expandable volumes.** You can now expand a secondary volume attached to a running virtual server instance. Use the `capacity` property in the [update volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-volume) method to request a new volume capacity, up to 16 TB (depending on the volume's profile).  While the volume's capacity is being updated, the volume will remain available for use, but will have a `status` value of `updating`. For more information, see [Expanding block storage volume capacity](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes).

   If you expand an existing data volume, be aware that existing applications will be exposed to the new `updating` value. To avoid disruption, first check that your applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected `status` values.

**Application load balancers.** Use the [HTTPS redirect feature](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers-about#https-redirect-listener) to redirect traffic from an HTTP load balancer listener to an HTTPS listener.

An HTTPS redirect can be configured on either [load balancer listeners](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers-about#https-redirect-listener) or [load balancer policies](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-layer-7-load-balancing#layer-7-policy), or both.  An HTTPS redirect is configured on the listener using the new `https_redirect` property, and will be used if none of the listener policy's rules match (or if it has no rules). An HTTPS redirect is configured on a load balancer policy using the new policy `action` value of `https_redirect`, and will be used only when all of the policy's rules match.

If you configure an HTTPS redirect on a listener policy, be aware that existing applications will be exposed to the new `https_redirect` value. To avoid disruption, check that your applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected `action` values first.
{: important}

Additional API restrictions are enforced after an HTTPS redirect is configured:

- You will not be able to [update the `protocol` and `accept_proxy_protocol` properties](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-load-balancer-listener) of the HTTP and HTTPS listeners. Instead, delete the listener and create a new listener with the new property values.
- You will not be able to [delete an HTTPS listener](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-load-balancer-listener) until the HTTP listener referring to it is deleted.

**Instance storage.** New instance profiles can now optionally include a set of solid state disks. These instance storage disks provide temporary storage to improve the performance of cloud-native workloads that need scratch space, large data caches, or data replicated across availability zones.

The following API methods have been added:

- [List all disks on an instance](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-disks) (`GET /instances/{instance_id}/disks`)
- [Retrieve an instance disk](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-instance-disk) (`GET /instances/{instance_id}/disks/{id}`)

- [Update a dedicated host disk](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-dedicated-host-disk) (`PATCH /dedicated_hosts/{dedicated_host_id}/disks/{id}`)

API methods that return instance and dedicated host profiles now include a `disks` property with information about the storage capability (where present) of resources provisioned with those profiles.

API methods that return instances and dedicated hosts now include a `disks` property with information about the disks configured for those resources.

**New parameter-based rule types for an application load balancer.** When creating a load balancer listener policy rule, the `field` property may now be set to `query` or `body` to perform additional forms of layer 7 load balancing:

- `query` - Write layer 7 rules that use the query string to route traffic to a specific target. For a `query` type rule, `field` and `value` must be percent-encoded, same as the query string in the URL.
- `body` - If the body of the `POST` request uses form encoding (UTF-8), then you can create layer 7 rules to route traffic based on the parameter name and value in the body. The `Content-Type` in the request is ignored.

If you use these new rule types, be aware that existing client applications will be exposed to those new values in the existing  properties. To avoid disruption, check that client applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected values for these properties before using these new rule types for an application load balancer.

A new `dedicated_host_only` property has been added to operating system resources. Any instance with a boot volume created from an image with `operating_system.dedicated_host_only` set to `true` must be placed on a dedicated host (or into a dedicated host group). Because Windows BYOL images have `dedicated_host_only` set to `true`, they must be placed on a dedicated host (or into a dedicated host group). There are no restrictions on placing instances using RHEL BYOL images.

**Additional VPN for VPC IKEv2 encryption/hash/Diffie Hellman (DH) group support.** For enhanced security, VPN for VPC now supports SHA2-512 (a Secure Hash Algorithm) and DH group 19 (a 256-bit elliptic curve algorithm) to generate a symmetric key.

If you use these new algorithms, be aware that existing client applications will be exposed to those new values in the existing `authentication_algorithm` and `dh_group` properties. To avoid disruption, check that client applications are written to gracefully handle unexpected values for these properties before using these new algorithms.

**Application load balancer security group integration.** For enhanced security, application load balancers can now be associated with security groups. You can specify one or more security groups when you create the application load balancer, and associate security groups with your existing application load balancers. If you omit security groups during load balancer creation, the default security group for the VPC is used.

If you plan to use default security groups for new application load balancers, review your default security group rules. If necessary, edit the rules to accommodate your expected application load balancer traffic.
{: tip}

The following load balancer methods have been updated:

- [Create a load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer) (`POST /load_balancers`) can now accept a list of security groups
- [Get load balancer details](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-load-balancer) (`GET /load_balancers/{id}`) now returns references to the security groups to which a load balancer is attached

New security group methods have been added for managing security group targets:

- [Attach a security group to a target network interface or load balancer](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-security-group-target-binding) (`PUT /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)
- [List targets attached to a security group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-security-group-targets) (`GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets`)
- [Retrieve a target in a security group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-security-group-target) (`GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)
- [Delete targets from a security group](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-security-group-target-binding) (`DELETE /security_groups/{security_group_id}/targets/{id}`)

Use the security group target methods to manage security group attachments to both load balancers and network interfaces. The original methods specific to network interfaces are now deprecated:

- `GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces`
- `DELETE /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`
- `GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`
- `PUT /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}`

For more information, see [Integrating an IBM Cloud Application Load Balancer for VPC with security groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-alb-integration-with-security-groups).

**Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) support for VPC.** VPC address prefixes are no longer restricted to [RFC-1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918){: external} addresses. You must now configure VPCs that use both non-RFC-1918 addresses and have public connectivity (floating IPs or public gateways) using a custom route that contains the new `delegate_vpc` property. You must specify this property for destination CIDRs that are non-RFC-1918 compliant and outside of the VPC, such as for destinations that are reachable through {{site.data.keyword.dl_full}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Transit Gateway, or VPC classic access.

The `delegate_vpc` property is not required if a VPC uses only RFC-1918 addresses or has no public connectivity.
{: note}

The following API methods have been updated:

- View the `delegate_vpc` property in the requests and responses for `/vpcs/{vpc_id}/routing_tables/{routing_table_id}/routes`.
- View reserved IP ranges in `POST /vpcs/{vpc_id}/address_prefixes`, which creates an address pool prefix.

Explore new API methods for [routing tables](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpc-routing-tables) and [routes](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-vpc-routing-table-route). This feature subsumes the [VPC routing API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-vpc-routes), which remains supported but is deprecated and might be removed in a future API release.

- **Virtual private endpoint gateways.** Use [virtual private endpoint gateways](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-endpoint-gateways) to connect to supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choice, which is allocated from a subnet within your VPC. For more information, see [About virtual private endpoint gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe).

- **VPC network interfaces.** IP anti-spoofing checks had already been provided for enhanced security. However, certain use cases, such as having a virtual server instance act as a network gateway, require selective disabling of these checks. To accommodate these use cases, if you have the `is.instance.instance.ip-spoofing` IAM action, you can now enable the `allow_ip_spoofing` property when you [create a network interface](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-instance-network-interface). Alternatively, toggle the property when you [update an existing network interface](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-instance-network-interface). See also [About IP spoofing checks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ip-spoofing-about).

- **Proxy protocol for application load balancers for VPC.** When you configure a load balancer [pool](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-pool) to use proxy protocol, the pool will pass information about the client to a back-end pool member when a connection is opened.

    You can also configure a load balancer [listener](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-load-balancer-listener) to accept proxy protocol information. This feature is useful when the client is, itself, a proxy (which, in turn, was connected to by the actual client) that supports the proxy protocol. This allows client information to be obtained and passed on to any pools that, themselves, have the proxy protocol enabled.

- `DELETE`, `GET`, and `PATCH` for `/instance_groups/{id}`
- `DELETE` for `/instance_groups/{instance_group_id}/load_balancer`
- `GET` and `POST` for `/instance_groups/{instance_group_id}/managers`
- `DELETE`, `GET`, and `PATCH` for `/instance_groups/{instance_group_id}/managers/{id}`
- `GET` and `POST` for `/instance_groups/{instance_group_id}/managers/{instance_group_manager_id}/policies`

You can also use the new [instance template](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-instance-templates) feature independently of auto scale. For example, create a template, and then create instances from that template, without creating an instance group.

The following new endpoints are now available for instances:

- `GET` and `POST` for `/instance/templates`
- `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` for `/instance/templates/{id}`

`POST /instances` now supports a `source_template`.

Usage recommendations are provided for the following load balancer properties:

- `protocol` property for load balancer pools
- `type` property for load balancer pool health monitors

The guidance notes that new values for these properties might be added in the future, and unexpected values are handled gracefully. See the [load balancers API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-load-balancers).

Support is temporarily suspended for creating instances from an existing boot volume. This feature was available through the API only, with no CLI or UI support. In the interim, you must specify the `image` property when you call `POST /instances`.

You can still create instances that reference existing data volumes.
