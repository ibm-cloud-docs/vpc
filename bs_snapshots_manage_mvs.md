# Managing snapshot consistency groups
{: #snapshots-vpc-manage-consistency-groups}

A snapshot consistency group contains snapshots of multiple volumes that are attached to the same virtual server instance. The snapshots are loosely coupled. So, you can manage the snapshots within a consistency group in the same way that you manage any other snapshot. You can rename or delete individual snapshots from the consistency group if you want to. Or you can keep individual snapshots after you decide to delete the consistency group.
{: shortdesc}

If you update the backup consistency group to keep the individual snapshots after the consistency group is deleted, a backup job is not created when the consistency group is deleted. The system creates an activity tracking event when the consistency group is deleted.

Fast restore snapshot clones and consistency groups are not supported for second-generation storage volumes during the select availability phase.

## Updating a consistency group from the CLI
{: #update-consistencygroup-cli}
{: cli}

You can update a consistency group from the CLI by running the following command. You can use the CLI to update the name of the resource and switch the `delete_snapshots_on_delete` property to keep the snapshots after the snapshot consistency group is deleted.

```sh
ibmcloud is snapshot-consistency-group-update CONSISTENCY_GROUP_ID
```
{: pre}

The following example changes the consistency group name. It identifies the consistency group by name. You can also use the ID of the consistency group with this command.

```sh
ibmcloud is snapshot-consistency-group-update multiple-snapshots-consistency-group-1 --name my-consistency-group

## Deleting a consistency group from the CLI
{: #delete-consistencygroup-cli}
{: cli}

You can delete a consistency group from the CLI by running the following command.

```sh
ibmcloud is snapshot-consistency-group-delete CONSISTENCY_GROUP_ID
```
{: pre}

The following example deletes two consistency groups that are identified by their names.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is snapshot-consistency-group-delete snapshot-consistency-group-1 snapshot-consistency-group-2

This will delete snapshot consistency group snapshot-consistency-group-1, snapshot-consistency-group-2 and cannot be undone. Continue [y/N] ?> y

Deleting snapshot consistency group snapshot-consistency-group-1, snapshot-consistency-group-2 under account Test account as user test.user@ibm.com...
OK

Deletion request for snapshot consistency groups snapshot-consistency-group-1, snapshot-consistency-group-2 has been accepted.

## Updating a consistency group with the API
{: #update-consistencygroup-api}
{: api}

You can programmatically update a consistency group by calling the `/snapshot_consistency_groups/{id}` method in the [VPC API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-snapshot-consistency-group){: external} as shown in the following sample request. You can use the API to update the name of the resource and switch the `delete_snapshots_on_delete` property to keep the snapshots after the snapshot consistency group is deleted.

```sh
curl -X PATCH\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/snapshot_consistency_groups/$consistency_group_id?version=2023-12-05&generation=2"
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
-d "{\
   "delete_snapshot_on_delete_snapshot_consistency_group":false,\
   "name":"my-snapshot-consistency-group"}"
```
{: pre}

## Deleting a consistency group with the API
{: #delete-consistencygroup-api}
{: api}

You can programmatically delete a consistency group by calling the `/snapshot_consistency_groups/{id}` method in the [VPC API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-snapshot-consistency-group){: external} as shown in the following sample request.

```sh
curl -X DELETE\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/snapshot_consistency_groups/$consistency_group_id?version=2023-12-05&generation=2"
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

## Updating a consistency group with Terraform
{: #update-consistencygroup-terraform}
{: terraform}

To update a snapshot consistency group, use the `ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group` resource. You can update the name of the resource, change the `delete_snapshots_on_delete` property, which can be either `true` or `false`. You can also update the tags that are attached to the snapshots.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group" "example" {
  delete_snapshots_on_delete = true
  name = "example-snapshot-consistency-group"
  snapshots {
    [
      name = "snapshot-1"
      source_volume = {id = "ibm_is_instance.example.volume_attachments[0].volume_id_1"}
      user_tags = ["my-tag"]
    ].
    [
      name = "snapshot-2"
      source_volume = {id = "ibm_is_instance.example.volume_attachments[0].volume_id_2"}
      user_tags = ["my-tag"]
    ]
  }
}
```
{: codeblock}

Changing the `resource_group` and `source_volume` values of the member snapshots forces Terraform to delete the snapshots and create different snapshots.

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_snapshot_consistency_group){: external}.

## Deleting a consistency group with Terraform
{: #delete-consistencygroup-terraform}
{: terraform}

Use the `terraform destroy` command to conveniently delete a remote object such as a snapshot consistency group. The following example deletes `my-snapshot-consistency-group`.

```terraform
terraform destroy --target ibm_is_snapshot_consistency_group.my-snapshot-consistency-group
```
{: codeblock}

For more information, see [terraform destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/destroy){: external}.

## Activity Tracking events
{: #consistency-groups-at-events}

All multi-volume snapshot operations generate events in {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} regardless if the consistency group was created manually or by the Backup service. For more information, see [Consistency group events](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-at_events&interface=ui#events-consistency-group).
