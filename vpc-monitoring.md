2. For each Virtual Private Cloud in the table, refer to columns for **Status** and **Health status**. See the following sections for available statuses and definitions.

## VPC resource status
{: #vpc-resource-status}

The following table shows the possible VPC resource statuses and a description of what each status means.

| Status| Description|

| Deleting        | The resource is in the process of being deleted.|
| Failed          | The resource is unreachable, inoperative, or otherwise incapacitated.|
| Pending         | The resource has been created, but the process is not yet complete.|
| Stable          | The resource is operating as expected.|

## Health status
{: #vpc-health-status}

The following table shows the possible VPC health statuses and a description of what each status means.

|Health status|Description|
|----------------|-----------|
| Degraded        | The resource is experiencing compromised performance, capacity, or connectivity.|
| Faulted         | The resource is unreachable, inoperative, or otherwise incapacitated.|
| Healthy         | No abnormal behavior detected.|
| Inapplicable    | The health state doesn't apply because of the current lifecycle status of the resource. For example, a lifecycle status of `deleting` will have a health state of `inapplicable`.|
