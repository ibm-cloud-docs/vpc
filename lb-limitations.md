# Known issues for application load balancers
{: #lb-limitations}

Known issues are identified bugs or unexpected behaviors that were not fixed before release, but werenâ€™t critical enough to delay it. These issues are communicated to you, often with workarounds, and are prioritized for resolution in the near term by the development team.
{: shortdesc}

Known issues for {{site.data.keyword.alb_full}} (ALB) are as follows: 

* Two members with the same instance X and same port Y cannot exist at the same time for an ALB. This case is not supported and your traffic might not be routed correctly.

* The default load balancer quota is 50 per region. To increase the number, you must [create a support case](/docs/account?topic=account-open-case).

* When a member target instance is deleted, an Application load balancer pool member is not automatically deleted.
