# Managing file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets
{: #file-storage-managing}

Manage the file shares that you created. You can rename a file share. You can increase its capacity and modify its IOPS. You can add mount targets to a file share, and use the mount path to mount a file share from virtual server instances. You can rename or delete a mount target. Or you can delete a file share if you no longer need it.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} service requires IAM permissions for role-based access control. For example, to create a file share, you need to have at least editor permissions. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for VPC Infrastructure Services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started&interface=ui) for file shares.
{: requirement}

## Differences in handling normal file shares and accessor shares
{: #file-storage-manage-shares-comparison}

The following sections contain instructions to modify and update various properties of file shares and mount targets. Due to the nature of the accessor shares, some properties (for example, file share profile, access control mode or allowed transit encryption modes) cannot be changed. Those properties are inherited from the origin share. For the accessor share properties that can be modified, the steps are the same as for updating a normal share. While it is not possible to create a snapshot of an accessor share, if the origin share has snapshots, you can access the snapshots in the `.snapshot` directory. This directory is read only.

## Managing file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets in the UI
{: #file-storage-manage-ui}
{: ui}

In the console, you can:

* [Rename a file share](#rename-file-share-ui).
* [Rename a mount target of a file share](#rename-mount-target-ui).
* [Update a file share profile](#fs-update-profile-ui) (not applicable for accessor shares).
* [Update allowed transit encryption modes](#fs-update-transit-encryption-ui) (not applicable for accessor shares).
* [Delete mount target of a file share](#delete-mount-target-ui).
* [Delete a file share](#delete-file-share-ui).
* [Add user tags to file shares](#fs-add-user-tags).

In the console, you can manage normal file shares and accessor shares. Only the share owner can modify properties like access control mode, IOPS, and profile. The accessor account cannot edit the origin share, and can modify a smaller set of properties of the accessor share.

Snapshots are supported only for shares that have security group as their access control mode. You can't change access control mode to VPC unless all the snapshots of the share are deleted.
{: note} 

### Renaming a file share in the UI
{: #rename-file-share-ui}

1. On the [file shares details](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view#fs-view-single-share-ui) page, click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") next to the file share name.

2. Provide a new name for the file share.

Valid file share names can include a combination of lowercase alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and the hyphen (-), up to 63 characters. File share names must begin with a lowercase letter.

### Renaming a mount target of a file share in the UI
{: #rename-mount-target-ui}

1. Go to the [file shares details](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view&interface=ui#fs-view-single-share-ui) page.
2. Click the Actions icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions").
3. Select **Rename**.
4. Enter a new name and click **Rename**.

Valid mount target names can include a combination of lowercase alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and the hyphen (-), up to 63 characters. Mount target names must begin with a lowercase letter.

### Updating a file share profile in the UI
{: #fs-update-profile-ui}

These instructions are for the previous generation of file share profiles (general purpose, 5-iops, 10-iops, or custom). To access the latest features, you must change the IOPS profile of your share to dp2. The profiles of file shares that were created with the `dp2` profile cannot be changed.
{: important}

You can change the profile for a file share from the current profile to another **IOPS tier** profile, to a **custom** profile, or to a high-performance **dp2** profile. Your billing adjusts based on the type of profile that you choose.

1. Go to the [file shares details](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view&interface=ui#fs-view-single-share-ui) page.
2. Click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") next to the current profile or use the **Actions** menu ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select **Edit IOPS profile**. A side panel shows the current profile, file share size, and maximum IOPS.
3. For a **New profile**, click the down arrow. You can select a new IOPS tier, a custom profile, or dp2. For **Custom IOPS** or **dp2**, specify a new max IOPS based on the file share size. The file share price is automatically calculated based on your selection.
4. Click **Save and continue**.

### Updating allowed transit encryption modes in the UI
{: #fs-update-transit-encryption-ui}

The owner of share can change the allowed transit encryption modes. However, before this property can be changed, all bindings must be deleted. Deleting the bindings severs the network path between origin file share and accessor share, and puts the mount target that is attached to the accessor share in a failed state. For more information, see [Removing access to a file share from other accounts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=ui).
{: important}

1. Select a file share from the [list of file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view).
1. On the File share details page, locate the allowed transit encryption modes.
1. Click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") to change the current value.

### Deleting file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets in the UI
{: #delete-targets-shares-ui}

Before you delete a file share, make sure that it is [unmounted](#fs-mount-unmount-vsi) from all virtual server instances and that all mount targets that belong to the file share are [deleted](#delete-mount-target-ui). If your file share is shared with another account, delete the accessor bindings before you delete the share. Also, if the file share has a replica file share, you must remove the replication relationship. For more information, see [Remove the replication relationship in the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=ui#fs-remove-replication-ui).

If the file share has snapshots, those snapshots are deleted along with the file share.
{: note}

#### Deleting share bindings of a file share in the UI
{: #delete-bindings-ui}

1. Select a file share from the [list of file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view#file-storage-view-shares-targets-ui).
1. On the File share details page, scroll to the Accessor share bindings section to locate the binding that you want to delete.
1. At the end of the row of the binding, click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select **Delete**.

#### Deleting mount target of a file share in the UI
{: #delete-mount-target-ui}

1. Select a file share from the [list of file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view#file-storage-view-shares-targets-ui).
2. On the File share details page, select a mount target that you want to delete.
3. Click the Actions icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") and select **Delete**.

#### Deleting a file share in the UI
{: #delete-file-share-ui}

The file share must be in a `stable` state or `failed` state.

1. Select a file share from the [list of file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view).
2. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") at the end of the row and select **Delete**.

### Deleting file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets from the CLI
{: #delete-share-targets-cli}

Before you delete a file share, make sure that it is [unmounted](#fs-mount-unmount-vsi) from all virtual server instances and that all mount targets that belong to the file share are [deleted](#delete-mount-target-cli).If your file share is shared with another account, delete the accessor bindings before you delete the share. Also, if the file share has a replica file share, you must remove the replication relationship. For more information, see [Remove the replication relationship from the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=cli#fs-remove-replication-cli).

1. Locate the file share that you want to delete by listing all the file shares with the `ibmcloud is shares` command.

#### Deleting a mount target of a file share from the CLI
{: #delete-mount-target-cli}

Run the `share-mount-target-delete` command and specify the file share and mount target by either their names or IDs. Type `y` when you're prompted. If more than one mount targets are attached to the file share, repeat this step until all mount targets are deleted.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is share-mount-target-delete my-file-share-8 my-new-mount-target
This will delete mounted target my-new-mount-target for share ID my-file-share-8 and cannot be undone. Continue [y/N] ?> y

{: pre}

For more information about the command options, see [`ibmcloud is share-mount-target-delete`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#share-mount-target-delete).

#### Deleting a file share from the CLI
{: #delete-file-share-cli}

The file share must be in a `stable` or `failed` state. To delete the file share, run the `share_delete` command and specify the file share by its name or ID.

```sh
$ ibmcloud is share-delete my-file-share-8
This will delete file share my-file-share-8 and cannot be undone. Continue [y/N] ?> y
Deleting file share my-file-share-8 under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
OK
File share my-file-share-8 is deleted.
```
{: screen}

For more information about the command options, see [`ibmcloud is share-delete`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#share-delete).

If the file share has snapshots, those snapshots are deleted along with the file share.
{: note}

### Update allowed transit encryption modes from the CLI
{: #fs-update-transit-encryption-cli}

The owner of the share can change the allowed transit encryption modes type to `user_managed,none`,`user_managed` or `none`. However, before this property can be changed, all bindings and [mount targets must be deleted](#delete-mount-target-cli). Deleting the bindings severs the network path between origin file share and accessor share, and puts the mount target that is attached to the accessor share in a failed state. For more information, see [Removing access to a file share from other accounts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=cli).

## Managing file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets with the API
{: #file-storage-manage-api}
{: api}

By using the API, you can:

* [Rename a file share](#rename-file-share-api).
* [Rename a mount target of a file share](#rename-mount-target-api).
* [Update a file share profile](#fs-update-profile-api) (not applicable for accessor shares).
* [Update allowed transit encryption modes with the API](#fs-update-transit-encryption-api) (not applicable for accessor shares).
* [Delete mount target of a file share](#delete-mount-target-api).
* [Delete a file share](#delete-file-share-api).
* [Manage user tags for file shares](#fs-add-user-tags).

To see information about the {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} API methods, see the following section in the [API reference](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-share-profiles).

Snapshots are supported only for shares that have security group as their access control mode. You can't change access control mode to VPC unless all the snapshots of the share are deleted.
{: note}

### Renaming a file share with the API
{: #rename-file-share-api}

Make a `PATCH /shares/$share_id` call to rename a specific file share. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X PATCH \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"\
  -d '{"name": "share-renamed1"}'
```
{: codeblock}

A successful response looks like the following example.

Valid file share names can include a combination of lowercase alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and the hyphen (-), up to 63 characters. File share names must begin with a lowercase letter.

### Renaming a mount target of a file share with the API
{: #rename-mount-target-api}

Make a `PATCH /shares/$share_id/mount_targets/$target_id` call to rename a mount target of a file share. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X PATCH \

{: codeblock}

Valid mount target names can include a combination of lowercase alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and the hyphen (-), up to 63 characters. Mount target names must begin with a lowercase letter.

### Updating a file share profile with the API
{: #fs-update-profile-api}

These instructions are for the previous generation of file share profiles (general purpose, 5-iops, 10-iops, or custom). To access the latest features, you must change the IOPS profile of your share to dp2. The profiles of file shares that were created with the `dp2` profile cannot be changed.
{: important}

Make a `PATCH /shares/{share_ID}` call and specify the profile name in the `profile` property. The following example changes the profile to a `dp2` profile.

```sh
curl -X PATCH "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/432f1a4d-4aac-4ba1-922c-76fdbcbeb1e3?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
-d '{"profile": {"name": "dp2"}}'
```
{: codeblock}

### Updating allowed transit encryption modes with the API
{: #fs-update-transit-encryption-api}

The owner of share can change the allowed transit encryption modes. However, before this property can be changed, all bindings and must be deleted. Deleting the bindings severs the network path between origin file share and accessor share, and puts the mount target that is attached to the accessor share in a failed state. For more information, see [Removing access to a file share from other accounts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=api).
{: important}

```sh
curl -X PATCH \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
  -d '{"allowed_transit_encryption_modes": "user-managed"}'
```
{: codeblock}

### Deleting file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets with the API
{: #delete-share-targets-api}

Before you delete a file share, make sure that it is [unmounted](#fs-mount-unmount-vsi) from all virtual server instances and that all mount targets that belong to the file share are [deleted](#delete-mount-target-api). If your file share is shared with another account, delete the accessor bindings before you delete the share.Also, if the file share has a replica file share, you must remove the replication relationship. For more information, see [Remove the replication relationship with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=api#fs-remove-replication-api).

#### Deleting share bindings of a file share with the API
{: #delete-bindings-api}

You can programmatically delete a share binding by calling the `/shares` method in the [VPC API](/apidocs/vpc/latest){: external} as shown in the following sample request.
{: api}

```sh
curl -X DELETE "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/v1/shares/$share_id/bindings/$binding_id?version=2024-06-21&generation=2"
```
{: pre}

#### Deleting mount target of a file share with the API
{: #delete-mount-target-api}

Make a `DELETE /shares/{share_ID}/mount_targets/{target_id}` call to delete a mount target of a file share. The file share must be in a `stable` state. A file share cannot be deleted, if an existing mount target is associated with that file share or if replica operations are in progress.

See the following example.

```sh
curl -X DELETE \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id/mount_targets/$target_id?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```
{: pre}

A successful response has a confirmation of acceptance for deletion and a response that contains the target information. 

The following example shows a mount target where `access_control_mode` is `security_group`. The response shows the security group and subnet. You can see the specifics of the reserved IP address that was used for the virtual network interface of the mount target in the `primary_ip` section. By default the virtual network interface is deleted along with the mount target when the mount target is deleted. Status of mount target shows _deleting_ while the deletion is underway.

The mount target is deleted in the background. Confirm the deletion by trying to view the mount target information. If you get an `404 Not Found` error, the mount target is successfully deleted.

#### Deleting a file share in the API
{: #delete-file-share-api}

The file share must be in a `stable` or `failed` state.

Make a `DELETE /shares/$share_id` call to delete a file share. The file share must be in a `stable` state or `failed` state (that is, when provisioning fails). A file share cannot be deleted, if an existing mount target is associated with that file share or if replica operations are in progress.

See the following example.

```sh
curl -X DELETE \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$share_id?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```
{: codeblock}

A successful response confirms acceptance for deletion and shows file share information. The status of file share is updated to _pending_deletion_. See the following example:

The file share is deleted in the background. Confirm the deletion by trying to view the mount target information. If you get a `404 Not Found` error, the mount target is successfully deleted. If the file share has snapshots, those snapshots are deleted along with the file share.

A `DELETE /shares/$share_id` call can optionally include an `If-Match` header that specifies an `ETag` hash string. Make a `GET /shares/{share_id}` call and copy the `ETag` hash string from the response header. For more information, see [User tags for file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about#fs-about-user-tags).
{: note}

## Managing file shares, accessor share bindings, and mount targets with Terraform
{: #file-storage-manage-terraform}
{: terraform}

With Terraform, you can:

* [Change file share attributes such as name, size, profile, tags](#file-storage-share-update-terraform),
* [Add](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create-replication&interface=terraform#fs-create-replica-terraform) or [remove a replica relationship](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=terraform#fs-remove-replication-terraform).
* [Change the name of a mount target](#file-storage-mount-target-update-terraform).
* [Delete a file share or a mount target](#delete-file-share-terraform).

### Updating attributes of a file share with Terraform
{: #file-storage-share-update-terraform}

Update the `ibm_is_share` resource to change any attributes of the file share such as name, size, profile, tags. When applied, the following example updates the share's name to `new_name`.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "new_name"
  size    = 300
  iops    = 5000
  profile = "dp2"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
}
```
{: codeblock}

Valid file share and mount target names can include a combination of lowercase alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and the hyphen (-), up to 63 characters. File share names must begin with a lowercase letter.
{: important}

Some attributes, such as profile, mount target access mode, allowed transit encryption modes, and encryption at rest, are not editable for accessor shares.

The owner of share can change the allowed transit encryption modes type to `user_managed`, `none`, or `user_managed,none`. However, before this property can be changed, all bindings and [mount targets must be deleted](#delete-file-share-terraform). Deleting the bindings severs the network path between origin file share and accessor share, and puts the mount target that is attached to the accessor share in a failed state. For more information, see [Removing access to a file share from other accounts](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=terraform).
{: important}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_is_share](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_share){: external}.

### Updating attributes of a mount target with Terraform
{: #file-storage-mount-target-update-terraform}

Update the `is_share_target` resource to change the name of the mount target. When applied, the following resource changes the name of the mount target to `my-new-share-target`.

```terraform
resource "is_share_target" "is_share_target" {
  share = is_share.is_share.id
  subnet = ibm_is_subnet.example.id
  name = "my-new-share-target"
}`
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_is_share_target](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_share_target){: external}.

### Deleting file shares, accessor share bindings, or mount targets with Terraform
{: #delete-file-share-terraform}

Before you delete a file share, make sure that it is [unmounted](#fs-mount-unmount-vsi) from all virtual server instances and that all mount targets that belong to the file share are deleted.If your file share is shared with another account, delete the accessor bindings before you delete the share. Also, if the file share has a replica file share, you must remove the replication relationship. For more information, see [Remove the replication relationship with Terraform](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=terraform#fs-remove-replication-terraform).

Use the `terraform destroy` command to conveniently delete a remote object such as a file share. The following example shows the syntax for deleting a share. Substitute the actual ID of the share in for `ibm_is_share.example.id`. To delete a mount target or a share binding, use their IDs with the same command.

```terraform
terraform destroy --target ibm_is_share.example.id
```
{: codeblock}

If the file share has snapshots, those snapshots are deleted along with the file share.

For more information, see [terraform destroy](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/destroy){: external}.

## Adding user tags to a file share
{: #fs-add-user-tags}

You can add user tags to new or existing file shares, modify, and delete tags for a file share with the UI, CLI, API, and Terraform. You can view tags throughout your account by filtering by tags from your resource list. You can also add user tags to replica file shares.

Up to 100 tags can be attached or detached in the same operation. When you edit your tags, the new tags overwrite the existing tags. To keep tags manageable, create only as many user tags as you require to effectively handle the resource.
{: tip}

You can manage your tags in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with the [Global Tagging API](/apidocs/tagging). With this API, you can create, delete, search, attach, or detach tags. For more information about managing tags for your account, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

### Adding user tags to file share in the UI
{: #fs-add-tags-shares-ui}
{: ui}

You can add user tags to a file share in the UI.

1. Go to the list of file shares. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../icons/vpc.svg) **> Storage > File Shares**.
2. Select a file share to view its details.
3. On the file share details page, user tags appear next to the file share name. Click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") to edit tags.
4. In the **Edit tags** window, type a tag in the User tags text box.
5. Click **Save**.

### Adding or modify file share user tags from the CLI
{: #fs-add-tags-cli}
{: cli}

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
{: requirement}

You can add tags when you provision a file share with the `ibmcloud is share-create` command. The `--user-tags` option specifies tags for the file share. For more information, see [Creating a file share with a mount target from the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create&interface=cli#fs-create-share-target-cli).

You can add and remove tags when you update a file share with the `ibmcloud is share-update` command.

1. Locate your share from the CLI by listing your file shares in the region with the `ibmcloud is shares` command.

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud is shares
   Listing shares in all resource groups and region us-south under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...

   ```
   {: screen}

1. Retrieve the details of the file share with the `ibmcloud is share` command.

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud is share my-file-share
   Getting file share my-file-share under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...

   ID                           r006-b696742a-92ee-4f6a-bfd7-921d6ddf8fa6

   {: screen}

1. Use the `ibmcloud is share-update` command with the `--user-tags` option to add a tag to the file share. If the file share had tags previously, they are overwritten by the tags that are specified in the command.

The following example adds two user tags to the file share.

   ```sh

### Adding or modify file share user tags with the API
{: #fs-add-tags-api}
{: api}

When you're working with the API, you must provide the `generation` parameter and specify `generation=2`. For more information, see **Generation** in the [Virtual Private Cloud API reference](/apidocs/vpc/latest#api-generation-parameter).
{: requirement}

#### Adding a user tag when a file share is created
{: #fs-add-tags-new-share-api}

Make a `POST /shares` request and specify the `user_tags` property. This example creates a share with three user tags, `env:test1`, `env:test2`, and `env:prod`.

```sh
curl -X POST \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"\
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
    -d '{
        "name": "share-name1",
        "size": 2300,
        "iops": 6000,
        "profile": {"name": "dp2"},
        "user_tags": [
           "env:test1",
           "env:test2",
           "env:prod"
        ],
        "zone": {"name": "us-south-1"}
      }'
```
{: codeblock}

#### Modifying user tags for an existing file share
{: #fs-add-tags-share-api}

Add new user tags to an existing file share by making a `PATCH /shares` request and specify the user tags in the `user_tags` property. If the file share did not have any tags, the new tags in the request are added. If the file share had tags previously, the new tags overwrite the previous tags.

The following example modifies a file share that is identified by ID by renaming the share and adding user tags.

```sh
curl -X PATCH\
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/432f1a4d-4aac-4ba1-922c-76fdbcbeb1e3?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\

#### Modifying file share user tags with ETag verification
{: #fs-modify-etag-api}

To ensure that updates to a file share are valid, you can obtain an `ETag` hash string value and specify it in the `If-Match` header in the `PATCH /shares/{share_id}` call. That confirms that no change happened to the share object between the last observed state and the state at the time of the `PATCH` call.

To modify existing user tags that are added to a file share, you first make a `GET /shares/{share_id}` call and copy the hash value from `ETag` property in the response header. Then, you send the `ETag` value by using the `If-Match` header in a `PATCH /shares/{share_id}` request. Specifying an `Etag` value ensures any updates to or deletions of a file share fail if the `If-Match` value does not match the file share's current `Etag`. Follow these steps:

1. Make a `GET /shares/{share_id}` call and copy the hash string from `ETag` property in the response header. Use need the hash string value for when you specify `If-Match` in the `PATCH /shares/{share_id}` request to modify user tags for the share in step 2.

   ```sh
   curl -sSL -D GET\ "https://us-south.cloud.ibm.com/v1/shares/{share_id}?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -o /dev/null
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   The response header looks similar to the following example:

   ```json
   HTTP/2 200
   date: Mon, 09 January 2023 17:48:03 GMT
   content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
   content-length: 1049
   cf-ray: 69903d250c4966ef-DFW
   cache-control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
   expires: -1
   strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC
   expect-ct: max-age=604800, report-uri="[uri...]"
   pragma: no-cache
   x-content-type-options: nosniff
   x-request-id: 1fbe2384-6828-4503-ae7d-050426d1b11b
   x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
   server: cloudflare
   etag: W/xxxyyyzzz123
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Make a `PATCH /shares/{share_id}` request. Specify the `ETag` hash string for the `If-Match` property in the header. Specify the user tag in the `user_tags` property.

   This example updates the file share user tags to `env:test` and `env:prod`. The hash string value that you obtained from the `ETag` property (`W/xxxyyyzzz123`) is specified in the `If-Match` header in the call.

   ```sh
   curl -X PATCH\
   "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/50fda9c3-eecd-4152-b473-a98018ccfb10?version=2023-08-08&generation=2"\
      -H "Authorization: Bearer"\
      -H "If-Match: W/xxxyyyzzz123"\
      -d `{
         "user_tags": [
            "env:test2",
            "env:prod2"
         ]
      }'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

### Adding or modify file share user tags with Terraform
{: #fs-add-tags-terraform}
{: terraform}

To apply user tags to a file share, use the `ibm_is_share` resource to create an argument in your `main.tf` file. The following example specifies the share `my-new-share` and the tag `dev:test` to be attached to the share. When applied, the tag is added to the share.

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_share" "example" {
  name    = "my-new-share"
  size    = 200
  iops    = 5000
  profile = "dp2"
  zone    = "us-south-2"
  tags    = ["dev:test"]
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Adding access management tags to a file share
{: #fs-add-access-mgt-tags}
{: ui}

Access management tags are metadata that you can add to your file shares to help organize access control resource relationships. You first create the tag and then add it to an existing file share or when you create a file share. You can apply the same access management tag to multiple file shares. You can assign access to the tag in {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM). Optionally, you can create an IAM access group and manage users.

### Step 1 - Creating an access management tag in IAM in the console
{: #fs-create-access-mgt-tag-ui}
{: ui}

In the console:

1. Go to **Manage > Account**, and then select **Tags**.
2. Click the **Access management tags** tab. Add a tag name in the field. Access management tags require a `key:value` format.
3. Click **Create Tags**.

### Step 1 - Creating an IAM access management tag from the CLI
{: #fs-create-access-mgt-tag-cli}
{: cli}

From the command line, enter the `ibmcloud resource tag-create` command to create an access management tag in your account. The following example creates a tag that is called `project:myproject`:

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource tag-create --tag-names project:myproject
    ```
    {: codeblock}

For more information, see the [`ibmcloud resource` command reference](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource).

### Step 1 - Creating an IAM access management tag with the API
{: #fs-create-access-mgt-tag-api}
{: api}

With the [Global Search and Tagging API](/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=api#create-access-api), make a `POST/ tags` request to [create an access management tag](/apidocs/tagging#create-tag). Specify the tag in the `tag_names` property. For an example, see [Creating access management tags by using the API](/docs/account?topic=account-tag&interface=api#create-access-api).

### Step 1 - Creating an IAM access management tag with Terraform
{: #fs-create-access-mgt-tag-terraform}
{: terraform}

Create an argument in your `main.tf` file. The following example creates the access management tag `ibm_tag` that is added to the `ibm` resource for the resource ID `ibm_is_share.example.crn`.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_resource" "ibm" {
   resource_id = ibm_is_share.example.crn
   tags        = [ "ibm_tag" ]
   }
   ```
    {: codeblock}

### Step 2 - Adding an access management tag to a file share
{: #fs-add-access-mgt-tag}

Add an access management tag to an existing file share or when you [create a file share](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-create). For an existing file share:

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, Go to the Resource list, and select a file share under **Storage** resources.
2. In the **Access management tags** field, type the name of an access management tag that you previously created. The tag appears as you type.
3. Save your changes.

### Step 3 - Creating an access group and assign access to users
{: #fs-access-mgt-additional-steps}

After you create an access management tag and apply it to a file share, complete the following steps to assign access and add users:

1. [Create an access group](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial#tagging-create-access-group). Access groups are assigned to policies that grant roles and permissions to the members of that group. You assign access to the specific access management tags for the file service. For more information about access groups, see [Setting up access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui).
2. [Assign an access policy to a group](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial#tagging-assign-policy).
3. [Add users to the access group](/docs/account?topic=account-access-tags-tutorial#tagging-add-users-access-group).

When you look at the specific resources for the VPC infrastructure and specify {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} as the resource type, you can see the access management tags for the file service.

## Removing access to a file share from other accounts
{: #fs-xaccount-access-removal}

Revoking access to a file share is a 2-step process.

1. Remove the IAM authorization between the accounts. Removal of IAM authorization prevents the other account or service from creating an accessor share and mount target.
   - [Removing an authorization in the console](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth&interface=ui#remove-auth){: ui}[Removing an authorization by using the CLI](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth&interface=cli#remove-auth-cli){: cli}[Removing an authorization by using the API](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth&interface=api#remove-auth-api){: api}[Removing an authorization by using Terraform](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth&interface=terraform#remove-auth-tf){: terraform}

1. Delete the share binding that connects the origin share with the accessor share. This action causes the mount target of the other account to enter a `failed` state.
   - [Deleting share bindings from the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=ui){: ui}[Deleting share bindings from the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=cli){: cli}[Deleting share bindings with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=api){: api}[Deleting share bindings with Terraform](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-delete&interface=terraform){: terraform}

## Mounting and unmounting file shares on a virtual server instance
{: #fs-mount-unmount-vsi}

Mounting is a process by which a server's operating system makes files and directories on the storage device available for users to access through the server's file system. To mount a file share to a virtual server instance, [locate the mount path information](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-view). The mount path is created when you create a mount target for the file share. See the following information for mounting on a few Linux operating systems. Other Linux distributions follow similar procedures.

* [Mounting file shares on Red Hat Linux](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-mount-RHEL).
* [Mounting file shares in CentOS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-mount-centos).
* [Mounting file shares on Ubuntu](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-mount-ubuntu).
* [Mounting file shares on z/OS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-mount-zos)

## Monitoring file shares
{: #fs-manage-monitor}

You can check the status and health states of your file share by using the console, the CLI, or the API. You can monitor the total throughput, the total IOPS, the number of mount targets, and capacity usage of your share over time in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. You can use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full}} to configure how to route auditing events for file shares. You can also configure {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} for handling logs. For more information, see [Monitoring file share health states, lifecycle status, and events](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-vpc-monitoring).

File shares can be integrated with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your shares. In the Sysdig web UI you can view the throughput, IOPS, and capacity metrics in more detail, customize your dashboards, and set up alerts. For more information, see [Monitoring metrics for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-vpc-monitoring-sysdig).
