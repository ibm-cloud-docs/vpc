# Planning data encryption
{: #vpc-encryption-planning}

When you're planning a data encryption strategy for your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes, snapshots, {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} shares, or custom images, you might find this checklist helpful.
{: shortdesc}

## Planning for data encryption
{: #planning-for-data-encryption}

Consider the following prerequisites before you set up data encryption for your VPC resources.

|     Considerations|
|-------------------|
|__ Evaluate the amount of control that you want over your data encryption. [IBM-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about#vpc-provider-managed-encryption) is provided by default for boot volumes, data volumes, and file shares. With [customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-about#vpc-customer-managed-encryption), you own the encryption keys and control the encryption process. |
|__ For encrypted custom images, review the image requirements, supported operating systems, and learn about creating and importing QCOW2 custom image files. For more information, see [Planning for custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images). |
|__ Evaluate which [key management service](#byok-encryption-prereqs) best meets your needs. Determine the availability of these services in your region and zone. |
|__ Determine whether your account can authorize access:  \n For Cloud Block Storage as the [source service](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-planning#byok-volumes-prereqs), Lite accounts must [upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account#upgrade-paygo) account or a Subscription account. For more information, see IBM Cloud [account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts). \n \n For {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}, specify VPC Infrastructure Services under (source service), check the box (Resource type), and choose {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} (target service). \n \n For custom images, authorize access between Image Service for VPC (source service) and {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (target service). Specify reader access for the role. \n \n For all VPC Source services, do not filter by resource group. Do not select the resource group checkbox.|
|__ For customer-managed encryption, consider importing or creating multiple root keys and [rotating your keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-key-rotation) for greater security.|
|__ Make sure you have a unique name for your virtual server instances, volumes, and file shares. For example, if you have a method for naming volumes with customer-managed encryption, it's much easier to filter and search for them later.|
|__ Determine how long you want to retain the resource and whether you might want to [make the data inaccessible](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-managing#instance-byok-inaccessible-data) for any reason.|

## Prerequisites for setting up customer-managed encryption
{: #byok-encryption-prereqs}

Complete the following prerequisites to configure customer-managed encryption for your VPC resources.

### Block and file storage prerequisites
{: #byok-volumes-prereqs}

Provision a key management service (KMS), and authorize access between your VPC resource and KMS.

1. When you provision a KMS, you can choose between [{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}](/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-getting-started-tutorial) and [{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-get-started). Follow the linked tutorials to provision a service instance, and create or import a customer root key.

1. From IBM {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM), [authorize access](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth#serviceauth) between Cloud Block Storage or Cloud File Storage (source service) and the target KMS service ({{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}). For more information, see [Establish service-to-service authorizations for File Storage for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-s2s-auth) and [Establishing service-to-service authorizations for {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-s2s-auth).

    You might need to upgrade your account to a Pay-as-you-go account to complete this set. For more information, see [Upgrading to a Pay-As-You-Go account](/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account#upgrade-paygo).

### Encrypted custom image prerequisites
{: #byok-custom-images-prereqs}

If you plan to import an encrypted custom image, follow the instructions in [Setting up your key management service and keys](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image#kms-prereqs).

* [Creating file shares with customer-managed encryptions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-byok-encryption).
* [Create custom encrypted images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-encrypted-custom-image).
