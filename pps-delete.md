# Updating and deleting a Private Path service
{: #pps-ui-updating-deleting}

You can migrate to a newer version of Private Path service without deleting or disrupting the service you provide to your current customers. You can delete a Private Path service using the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform.
{: shortdesc}

## Update a Private Path service in the UI
{: #pps-ui-update-private-path-service}
{: ui}

To update a Private Path provider service the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, follow these steps:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login) and log in to your account.
1. Select the **Navigation Menu** ![Menu icon](images/menu_icon.png), then click **Infrastructure > Network > Private Path services**.
1. In the Private Path services for VPC table, locate and click the name of the Private Path service that you want to update.
1. On the Private Path details page, click the Edit icon ![Edit icon](images/edit.png) beside the details that you want to update.

You can also update the members attached to a Private Path NLB in your Private Path service. For more information, see [Updating a network load balancer in the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-updating&interface=ui).
{: note}

### Update the target service of a Private Path service in the UI
{: #pps-ui-update-target-private-path-service}
{: ui}

If you’re updating the actual target service without changing the load balancer, you don’t need to take any actions in Private Path service. Instead, you need to update the Private Path network load balancer. For more information, see [Reviewing connection requests](/docs/private-path?topic=private-path-pps-ui-reviewing&interface=ui).

To update the target service of a Private Path provider service the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, follow these steps:

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login) and log in to your account.
1. Select the **Navigation Menu** ![Menu icon](images/menu_icon.png), then click **Infrastructure > Network > Load balancers**.
1. Select the region of your load balancer.
1. Select the load balancer that you want to update.
1. Select **Back-end pools** > **Create pool** to create a new pool of servers for your updated service.
1. Select the new options for your pool. You have the following options:

   * **Pool Name**: The name for your pool. Ideally, a name that describes the function that is performed by this pool.
   * **Protocol**: The network traffic protocol for your traffic.
   * **Method**: The load-balancing algorithm for the pool.
   * **Session stickiness**: Whether all requests during a user's session are sent to the same instance.
   * **Health check**: For more information about configuring health checks, see [Working with health checks](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-health-checks#nlb-health-checks).
1. Make sure to configure these servers for your new provider service by setting the **Method** to Weighted round robin for your old pool and your new pool. Set the **Weight** of the new pool to a non-zero value, and the **Weight** of the old pool to a zero value. This will redirect traffic from your old server pool to your new server pool.
1. Update your existing front-end listener to finish attaching your load balancer to this new pool. On your load balancer details page, Click the **Front-end listeners** tab. In the table, click the **Navigation Menu** ![navigation menu](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) at the end of the row of your existing listener, then click **Edit**.
1. In the menu that appears, click **Edit**. Under Default Back-end pool, type in the ID of your new pool. Click **Save**.

### Deleting a Private Path service in the UI
{: #pps-ui-deleing-private-path-service}
{: ui}

To delete a Private Path service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, follow these steps:

1. Revoke accounts associated with any active VPE gateways. For more information, see [Updating and deleting an account policy](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-pps-update-account&interface=ui).

   The consumer gets notified that their account is denied and the VPE gateway changes to `failed` state.
   {: note}

1. From your browser, open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login) and log in to your account.
1. Select the **Navigation Menu** ![navigation menu](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Infrastructure > Network > Private Path services**.
1. In the Private Path services for VPC table, locate the Private Path service that you want to delete, then click **Delete** in the Actions menu ![Actions menu](images/overflow.png).

## Updating a provider service from the CLI
{: #pps-cli-update-provider-service}
{: cli}

The following example shows how to update a Private Path provider service from the CLI.

To update a Private Path service from the CLI, follow these steps:

1. Enter the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is private-path-service-gateway-update PRIVATE_PATH_SERVICE_GATEWAY --name NEW_NAME [--default-access-policy deny | permit | review] [--load-balancer LOAD_BALANCER] [--published] [--zonal-affinity false | true] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

Where:

`PRIVATE_PATH_SERVICE_GATEWAY`

`--default-access-policy`
:   Indicates the policy to use for bindings from accounts without an explicit account policy. One of: `deny`, `permit`, `review`. Default: `deny`.

`--load-balancer`
:   Indicates ID or name of load balancer for this Private Path service.

`--published`
:   Indicates the availability of this Private Path service. If passed, value is set to `true`. A `true` value means account can request access to this Private Path service.

`--zonal-affinity`
:   Indicates whether this Private Path service has zonal affinity. One of: `false`, `true`.

`--name`
:   Indicates the new name of the Private Path service.

`--output`

## Updating a Private Path service with the API
{: #pps-api-update-provider-service}
{: api}

To update a Private Path provider service  with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli).
1. Store the following values in variables to be used in the API command:

   * `ppsgId` - Get your Private Path service and then populate the variable:

      ```sh
      export ppsgId=<your_ppsg_id>
      ```
      {: pre}


1. When all variables are initiated, do one of the following:

   * To update a Private Path service:

      ```sh
      curl -X PATCH -sH "Authorization:${iam_token}" \
      "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/private_path_service_gateways/$ppsgId?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
      -d {
         "zonal_affinity": true
       }'
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      The above example updates the Private Path service zonal affinity to `true`.

To delete a Private Path service with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli).
1. Store the following values in variables to be used in the API command:

   * `ppsgId` - Get your Private Path service and then populate the variable:

      ```sh

      "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/private_path_service_gateways/$ppsgId?version=$api_version&generation=2"
      ```
      {: codeblock}

## Updating and deleting a Private Path service with Terraform
{: #update-delete-pps-terraform}
{: terraform}

Updating and Deleting a Private Path Service by using Terraform is done with the same resource.

The following example updates and delete an endpoint gateway binding to a Private Path network by using Terraform:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_private_path_service_gateway" "ppsg" {
    default_access_policy = "deny"
    load_balancer = ibm_is_lb.ppnlb.id
    service_endpoints = ["my-service.example.com"]
    zonal_affinity = false
    name = "my-example-ppsg"
}
```
{: codeblock}
