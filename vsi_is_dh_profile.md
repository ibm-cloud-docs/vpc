# x86-64 dedicated host profiles
{: #dh-profiles}

 A dedicated host profile is a combination of attributes, such as the number of vCPUs, amount of RAM, and optional instance storage that define the amount of compute capacity that is provided in a host that is provisioned exclusively for your use.
{: shortdesc}

Dedicated hosts are available in various profile sizes to best suit the size and scale of your workloads: Balanced, Compute, Memory, Very High Memory, and Ultra High Memory. All virtual server instances that are provisioned on the dedicated host are provisioned from the same family and class of profiles. For example, if you choose a Memory profile for your dedicated host, all instances that are provisioned on the host must also be created with a Memory virtual server profile. If you choose a Compute with instance storage dedicated host, all instances that are provisioned on the host must also be created with Compute with instance storage virtual server profiles. This set up helps make sure that you can always use the entire dedicated host resource.

For more information about dedicated host profiles for IBM Z (s390x processor architecture), see [s390x dedicated host profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-s390x-dh-profiles).



For x86-64 dedicated host profiles, only the Madrid region supports dedicated host profiles with instance storage.
{: important}

The following profile families are available:

| Families | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [Balanced](#balanced-dh-pr) | Best for midsize databases and common cloud applications with moderate traffic. Balanced profiles are offered with and without instance storage. |
| [Compute](#compute-dh-pr) | Best for workloads with intensive CPU demands, such as medium to high web traffic workloads, production batch processing, and front-end web servers. Compute profiles are offered with and without instance storage. |
| [Memory](#memory-dh-pr) | Best for memory intensive processes, such as memory caching, intensive database applications, or in-memory analytics workloads. Memory profiles are offered with and without instance storage. |
|[Very High Memory with instance storage](#vhm-is-dh-pr) | Best for OLAP workloads and SAP-related services, such as SAP NetWeaver. The Very High Memory profile offers 1 vCPU to 14 GiB of RAM memory ratio. This profile is hosted exclusively on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum Cascade Lake server, and includes instance storage for temporary swap space or cache. |
|[Ultra High Memory with instance storage](#uhm-is-dh-pr) | Best for in-memory OLTP databases, such as SAP. The Ultra High Memory profile offers the highest vCPU to memory ratios with 1 vCPU to 28 GiB of RAM. This profile is hosted exclusively on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum Cascade Lake server and includes instance storage for temporary swap space or cache|

## Balanced
{: #balanced-dh-pr}

The Balanced profile provides a good mix of performance and scalability for more common workloads.

The Balanced with instance storage profile provisions your host with the capability for hosting instances that include [instance storage](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-instance-storage). If you provision a dedicated host with a Balanced instance storage profile, any virtual server instances that are provisioned on the dedicated host must also be provisioned with a Balanced profile that includes instance storage. Profiles with instance storage include *d* in the profile name, for example *bx2d* or *bx3d*.

The Balanced profile family of dedicated hosts on Intel&reg; x86-64 systems are deployed on one of the following processors:
- *bx2* and *bx2d* profiles can be deployed on an Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8260 Cascade Lake processor with 96 cores in a 4-socket configuration.
- *bx2* and *bx2d* profiles can be deployed on an Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Gold 6248 Cascade Lake processor with 80 cores in a 4-socket configuration.
- *bx3d* profiles are deployed on a custom Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8474C Sapphire Rapids processor with 96 cores in a 2-socket configuration.

New 3rd generation profiles are available in the Dallas, London, Frankfurt, Toronto,  and Madrid regions to create dedicated hosts on hardware that uses 4th Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable processors, the Intel 8474C processor (previously code named Sapphire Rapids).

## Viewing profile configurations
{: #dh-popular-profiles}

You can view available profile configurations by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the CLI. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, you can select from popular profile configurations that support the most common use cases.

### Understanding profiles
{: #dh-profiles-naming-rule}

The following example describes the individual parts that make up a dedicated host profile name, for this example, `bx2d-host-152x608`. The prefix `bx2d` is composed of the family, architecture, generation, and specialty. Together this information comprises the profile *class*.

| Family | Architecture | Generation | Specialty | Offering | vCPU | RAM |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------| -------- | ---- | --- |
| b      | x            | 2         | d-        | host-    | 152x | 608  |
{: caption="Individual parts that comprise the dedicated host profile" caption-side="bottom"}


The first character represents the profile family. Different profile families have different ratios of CPU to memory, which is designed for different workloads.
-	"b": balanced family, 1:4 ratio
-	"c": compute family (higher on the CPUs), 1:2 ratio
-	"m": memory family (higher on the memory), 1:16 ratio
- "v": very high memory family (higher memory with instance storage), 1:14 ratio
- "u": ultra high memory family (higher memory with instance storage), 1:28 ratio

The second character represents the CPU architecture.
- "x": x86_64
- "z": System Z

The third character represents the generation of VPC the profile is for.
-	The generation of the underlying hardware

The fourth character in the profile prefix, if it exists, represents a profile specialty.
-	"d": indicates that this profile creates a dedicated host with the capability to host virtual server instances that include instance storage.
- "a": AMD manufactured

The field after the first hyphen "-" represents the offering, in this example, the dedicated host offering.

The field after the second hyphen "-" represents the number of vCPU and the size of RAM (GB). "152x608" means that this profile has 152 vCPU and a RAM of 608 GB.

For the “bx2d-host-152x608” profile, you can know from the name that it is a Balanced Instance Storage host profile with a 1:4 CPU to memory ratio (152 vCPU and 608 GB RAM). The CPU architecture is x86_64 and this profile is for second-generation hardware.

### Using the IBM Cloud console
{: #dh-profiles-using-console}
{: ui}

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Dedicated hosts**.
2. From the Dedicated host page, click **Create**.
3. You can select from available profile configurations.

### Using the CLI
{: #dh-profiles-using-cli}
{: cli}

To view the list of available profiles by using the CLI, run the following command:
```sh
ibmcloud is dedicated-host-profiles
```
{: codeblock}

## Intel Hyper-Threading Technology
{: #profiles-hyper-threading}

All Intel&reg;-based servers operate with the Intel&reg; Hyper-Threading Technology enabled. Hyper-Threading Technology provies 2 vCPUs for every physical core in the box. Hyper-Threading Technology can also be disabled if needed. For more information, see [Disabling Intel Hyper-Threading Technology](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-disabling-hyper-threading).

## Querying dedicated host capacity
{: #profiles-query-dedicated-host-capacity}

For licensing purposes, you can retrieve the total physical capacity of the dedicated host that includes the compute that is held back for intensive resource usage. To see the total physical dedicated host compute, use the `GET` API command to query the dedicated host. The `GET` command returns both `available_memory` and `available_vcpu`. A vCPU is 1/2 of a physical core. For more information, see [Retrieve a dedicated host](/apidocs/vpc#get-dedicated-host).
