Storage_generation API property
:   An informational API property is introduced for Block Storage volume profiles, volumes, and snapshots to help identify which storage generation the volumes and snapshots belong to. When you [create a volume](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-volume), it inherits the generation value from the volume profile that is selected. When you [create a snapshot](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-snapshot) of a block volume, the snapshot inherits the `storage_generation` from the `source_volume`. Similarly, when a volume is created from a snapshot, it inherits the `storage_generation` value from the snapshot. For more information, see [Viewing available volume profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles&interface=api#using-api-iops-profiles).

Secure boot for Virtual Servers for VPC (GA)
:   Secure boot is now generally available. Secure boot is a security standard that makes sure that your server starts with trusted software by verifying the digital signatures for all code in the boot process. When a server starts in secure boot mode, the firmware checks the signature of the boot software, including UEFI firmware drivers, EFI applications, and the operating system. If the signatures are valid, the server boots, and the firmware grants control to the operating system. Which means that secure boot helps prevent malicious software from loading when your server starts. For more information, see [Secure boot for Virtual Servers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-confidential-computing-with-secure-boot-vpc&interface=ui).

Protocol state filtering on virtual network interfaces can be updated
:   Protocol state filtering works well if the packet forwarding path and the return path are the same, and if the packet forwarding path is never changed. However, the VPC routing table supports two-way ECMP routes. When a two-way ECMP route is configured, the forward path might differ from the return path and protocol state filtering can cause legitimate packets to drop. You can now disable protocol state filtering when intermittent routing issues occur. For more information, see [Protocol state filtering mode](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about#protocol-state-filtering).

Third-party image billing and metering (GA)

Advertise routes to transit gateway and direct link for ingress routing integration
:   VPN for VPC now allows route advertisement so that on-prem CIDR blocks can be advertised to other VPCs without creating address prefixes. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-advertise-routes-s2s). For more information about migrating to advertised routes, see [VPN for VPC migration to advertise routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-advertise-routes-s2s#migrate-to-advertise-routes-s2s).

   Client VPN for VPC now allows route advertisement so that on-prem CIDR blocks can be advertised to other VPCs by creating a `deliver` action instead of a `translate` action. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation). For more information about migrating to advertised routes, see [Client VPN for VPC migration to advertise routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation#advertise-routes-c2s).

VPN for VPC: Configurable IKE identity and peer FQDN
:    When you configure a VPN gateway connection, you can now specify a peer FQDN as the peer gateway address. This allows you to use a dynamic public IP on the peer gateway. The VPN gateway connection also supports configuring the IKE identity with supported types: IPv4 address, FQDN, Hostname, and Key ID. The default local IKE identity value is the public IP address of the active member of the VPN gateway while the default peer IKE identity value is the peer gateway address or FQDN.

   You can control which side initiates IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes on the VPN gateway connection. By default, the VPN gateway initiates IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes while also accepting IKE protocol negotiations or rekeying from the peer gateway. You can disable the VPN gateway from initiating IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes, and instead accept only the peer gateway to initiate IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes by setting Establish mode to `Peer only`. This enhancement enables you to connect the peer gateway behind a firewall and avoid conflicts in IKE negotiations. For more information, see [Creating a VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-gateway&interface=ui).

Ubuntu 24.04 now available to provision virtual servers
:    Support for the Ubuntu 24.04 release, codenamed "Noble Numbat", is now available. You can use the *ibm-ubuntu-24-04-minimal-amd64-1* stock image to provision virtual server instances.

Virtual Network Interfaces for VPC
:   A new feature is generally available in the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service that expands the support for [virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about). The following features are available.
   - Virtual network interfaces have an independent lifecycle, which means that when you delete a resource to which the virtual network interface is attached, the virtual network interface persists and retains its IP address.
   - New instances and bare metal servers can be created with virtual network interfaces attached to new child resources called network attachments.
   - Virtual network interfaces support secondary IP addresses.
   - For compatibility with existing clients, instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces include a read-only representation of their network attachments and virtual network interfaces as legacy network interface child resources.
   - For instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces, the IAM permissions for options to allow IP spoofing or disable infrastructure NAT are managed on their attached virtual network interfaces.
   - Flow log collectors can target instance network attachments and virtual network interfaces.

   You can choose to defer access to this feature through [IBM Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter). Users in an account that has deferred access will not be able to create instances or bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces. If you need more time to assess, remediate, and test changes for virtual network interfaces, request deferral for your production accounts while you complete the mitigations using your test accounts.

Virtual Network Interfaces for VPC (Select availability)
:   Accounts that have been granted special approval can preview a new feature in the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service that expands the support for [virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about). The following features are available.
   - Virtual network interfaces have an independent lifecycle, which means that when you delete a resource to which the virtual network interface is attached, the virtual network interface persists and retains its IP address.
   - New instances and bare metal servers can be created with virtual network interfaces attached to new child resources called network attachments.
   - Virtual network interfaces support secondary IP addresses.
   - For compatibility with existing clients, instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces include a read-only representation of their network attachments and virtual network interfaces as legacy network interface child resources.
   - For instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces, the IAM permissions for options to allow IP spoofing or disable infrastructure NAT are managed on their attached virtual network interfaces.
   - Flow log collectors can target instance network attachments and virtual network interfaces.

   If you have automation for managing your virtual network interfaces, bare metal servers, and file share mount targets, and you are not interested in expanded support for virtual network interfaces, you'll have the option to opt out when the feature becomes generally available.

IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11` updates
:  For the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11`, new certificates are available.
   - Attestation certificate
   - Encryption certificate
   - Intermediate certificate

   Support for customer-managed keys through integration with Hyper Protect Crypto Services
   - **Without** the feature, the data volume that you attach to your instance is encrypted automatically with a LUKS passphrase generated by using the **two** seeds from the `workload` - `volumes` and `env` - `volumes` sections of the contract. **Starting from the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11`**, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers support integration with the key management service (KMS) Hyper Protect Crypto Services. You can enable the integration by providing KMS configurations in the contract. Your Hyper Protect Virtual Server instance calls Hyper Protect Crypto Services to generate a random value as the third seed and wrap it with your root key. The wrapped seed is stored in the metadata partition of your data volume. The LUKS passphrase is generated by using **three** seeds - the seed in the metadata partition (unwrapped first) and the two seeds from the contract. For more information about how the integration works and detailed instructions, see [Securing your data](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-hyper-protect-virtual-server-mng-data).

   Deploying multiple containers
   - In the `workload` section of the contract, you can define the workload via Pod descriptors. Each pod can contain one or more container definitions. Previously, only one container described by docker compose was supported. For more information about using Pod descriptors, see the [`play` subsection](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-contract_se#hpcr_contract_play). Container images described by Pod descriptors can be [validated by RedHat Simple Signing](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-contract_se#container-image-by-pod-descriptors).

   Changes to the attestation document
   - In the attestation document **se-checksums.txt**, `user-data.decrypted` is removed, and `Machine Type/Plant/Serial` (the information required to identify the host machine) is added. For more information, see [Attestation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-attestation).

Instance group integration with network load balancers (GA)
:  Network Load Balancer for VPC is now integrated with instance groups to improve pool member scaling. When you create or update an instance group for auto scaling, you can now specify the Network Load Balancer pool for the instance group to manage. For more information see [Creating an instance group for auto scaling](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group).

Access control modes and granular authorization for File Storage for VPC file shares (beta)
:   For users with accounts that have access to file shares, you can now specify an access control mode to either restrict mounting a file share to a specific virtual server instance in the VPC or allow VPC-wide file share mounting. File share mount targets that were created before `20-June-2023` have a default of VPC-wide file share mounting. File shares that are created after that date can specify security group access control mode to restrict access to a specific instance. For this option, file shares must be based on the [`dp2` profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui#dp2-profile). From the UI, CLI, or API, you set the access control mode when you create or update file shares, and can see the setting when you list file shares and in the file share details. When you create a mount target for a file share with security group access mode, you can specify a [virtual network interface](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about) to be created and attached to the mount target with a [security group](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-security-groups). For the virtual network interface, you can specify an existing reserved IP, or specify a subnet and allow the system to assign an IP address. When the mount target is attached and the share is mounted, the virtual network interface performs security group policy check to ensure only authorized virtual server instances can communicate with the share. For more information, see [Mount targets for file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about#fs-share-mount-targets).

Data encryption in transit for file shares (beta)
:  For users with accounts that have access to file shares, you can enable secure end-to-end encryption of your data when using security group based access control on file shares and mount targets with virtual network interfaces. The traffic between the authorized virtual server and the file share can optionally be IPsec encapsulated by the client. By using an Internet Security Protocol (IPsec), you can establish an encrypted mount connection between the virtual server instance and a file share with the `dp2` profile. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} file service provides a [mount helper utility](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-mount-helper-utility) to automate the complex tasks of configuring and maintaining the connection. For more information, see [Encryption in transit - Securing mount connections between file share and host](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit).

Virtual network interface (beta)
:  Virtual network interfaces are now available in a beta release for use with file share mount targets. For more information see [About virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about).

VPC routing table authorizations
:   You can use the new VPC routing table authorizations to allow users to administer VPC routing tables but not allow them to administer the broader VPC. Routing table operations were updated to check for these new authorizations, instead of the broader VPC authorizations. The VPC Administrator, Editor, Operator, and Viewer IAM access roles were updated so that users with those roles function as before. However, custom roles that require access to routing tables must be updated.

Instance provision by volume
:   You can now reuse an existing boot volume to provision a virtual server instance. The specified volume must be unattached, be in the same zone as the instance profile, and must have an operating system with the same architecture as the instance profile. By default, a boot volume that was created as part of provisioning a virtual server instance is deleted when the instance is deleted. You can control this behavior when you create or update an instance. For more information, see [Creating virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=ui), and [Managing virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-virtual-server-instances&interface=ui).

Designating VPC route priority
:   When multiple VPC routes exist for a destination, you can now control the priority of these routes (from `0` to `4`). New and existing routes, which are created without a priority value, are automatically set to the default priority (`2`). Smaller values have higher priority. For more information, see [Determining route preference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cr-determining-route-preference).

   The route priority is considered on identical destinations only.

IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-9` updates
:  For the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-9`, new certificates are available.
   - Attestation certificate
   - Encryption certificate
   - Intermediate certificate

   Two partitions in new data volume
   - For new {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} instances, the data volume is partitioned into two parts. The first partition (100Mib) is reserved for internal metadata; the second partition remains as the data volume for workload. Only new volumes are partitioned, and you can't use the partitioned volume with an older version of the HPCR image. Provisioning with an existing encrypted volume also works. The difference is that the existing volume does not get partitioned, and you can also go back to an older image with this volume.

   Support for using a dynamic registry reference
   - There exist use cases in which the registry is **not known** when the workload section is pre-encrypted, for example, when the workload provider wants to allow the deployer to use a registry mirror or a private container registry.

Additional VPN for VPC ciphers
:    VPN gateways now provide new algorithms to help meet your security and compliance requirements.

   * IKE policy now supports the `sha384` value for authentication, `aes192` for encryption, and `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, and `31` values for Diffie–Hellman groups.

   * IPsec policy now supports `sha384` and `disabled` values for authentication, `aes192`, `aes128gcm16`, `aes192gcm16`, and `aes256gcm16` values for encryption, and `group_15`, `group_16`, `group_17`, `group_18`, `group_20`, `group_21`, `group_22`, `group_23`, `group_24`, and `group_31` Diffie–Hellman groups.

   Specifying IKE and IPsec policies when configuring a VPN connection is optional. If a policy is not selected, one is chosen through *auto-negotiation*. For more information, see [About policy negotiation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn#policy-negotiation).
