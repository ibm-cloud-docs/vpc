# Encryption in transit - Securing mount connections between file share and compute host
{: #file-storage-vpc-eit}

You can enable secure end-to-end encryption of your data when you use zonal and regional file shares with security-group-based access control mode and mount targets with virtual network interfaces. When such a mount target is attached and the share is mounted on a host, the VNI checks the security group policy to ensure that only authorized servers can access the share.    

If you choose to use Encryption-in-transit, you need to balance your requirements between performance and enhanced security. Encrypting data in transit can have some performance impact due to the processing that is needed to encrypt and decrypt the data at the endpoints. The impact depends on the workload characteristics. Workloads that perform synchronous writes or bypass VSI caching, such as databases, might have a substantial performance impact when EIT is enabled. To determine EITâ€™s performance impact, benchmark your workload with and without EIT. 

Even without EIT, the data moves through a secure data center network. For more information about network security, see [Security in your VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-security-in-your-vpc) and [Protecting Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Infrastructure Services with context-based restrictions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cbr).

IBM Cloud provides two options for in-transit encryption for file shares. 
- You can establish an encrypted mount connection between the compute host and a zonal file share by using the Internet Security Protocol (IPsec) security profile and X.509 certificate. For more information, see [Encryption in transit - IPsec encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit-ipsec).
- [Beta]{: tag-cyan} You can establish an encrypted mount connection between the compute host and a regional file share by creating a stunnel connection (TLS 1.2+) between the client VSI and NFS server. For more information, see [Encryption in transit - TLS encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit-tls).
