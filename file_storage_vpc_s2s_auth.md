# Establishing service-to-service authorizations for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}
{: #file-s2s-auth}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM) to create or remove an authorization that grants one service access to another service. For {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}}, you need to create service-to-service authorization for configuring customer-managed encryption and setting up cross-region replication.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #file-s2s-auth-overview}

In an authorization, the source service is the service that is granted access to the target service. The roles that you select define the level of access for the source service. The target service is the service that you are granting permission to be accessed by the source service based on the roles that you assign. Generally, a source service can be in the same account where the authorization is created or in another account. The target service is always in the account where the authorization is created. 

To be able to create an encrypted file share with a Customer Root Key (CRK), you must first have an instance of a Key Management Service (KMS) to hold your CRK. You can choose between {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. Then, you need to establish service-to-service authorization between the file service and the KMS instance. The authorization must be created in the account that owns and hosts the customer root key. The account that holds the CRK is the source, and the account where the file share is to be created is the target. 

For cross-region replication, you need to establish service-to-service authorizations and specify [user roles](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions#is.share-roles) for the various File Storage Service instances in different VPCs. This authorization enables the File Storage service in one VPC to interact with the File Storage Service of another VPC. Both VPCs must belong to the same account. Cross-account replication is not supported. For more information, see [Replication overview](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication).

For cross-account access, you need to establish service-to-service authorizations between the File Storage service of two different accounts. The authorization must be created in the account that owns and hosts the file share. You must also specify [user roles](/docs/account?topic=account-iam-service-roles-actions#is.share-roles) in both accounts to allow the users to create and manage accessor shares and share bindings. For more information, see [Sharing and mounting a file share from another account](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-accessor-create).

For more information about authorizations, see [Using authorizations to grant access between services](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceauth).

## Creating authorization for customer-managed encryption from the CLI
{: #file-s2s-auth-encryption-cli}
{: cli}

Log in to your account. Run the `ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create` command to create authorization policies for the File Storage Service to interact with your instance of one or both Key Management Services ({{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}). The source service is `is` with the `--source-resource-type share` and the target service is either `kms` or `hs-crypto`. The role that you need to assign is `Reader`. The following example creates an authorization policy between the File Storage Service and {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. 

```sh
$ ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create is kms Reader --source-resource-type share
Creating authorization policy under account a1234567 as test.user@ibm.com...
OK
```
{: screen}

To list the service authorizations that are already in place for the account, run the `ibmcloud iam authorization-policies` command. The following example shows that the file shares can be encrypted with a CRK that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.

```sh
$ ibmcloud iam authorization-policies
Getting authorization policies under account a1234567 as test.user@ibm.com...

## Creating authorization for cross-account encryption from the CLI
{: #file-s2s-xaccount-encryption-cli}
{: cli}

Log in to the account that holds the instance of a Key Management Service ({{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}). Run the `ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create` command to create authorization policies for the File service to interact with the KMS. The source service is `is` with the `--source-resource-type share` and the target service is either `kms` or `hs-crypto`. The role that you need to assign is `Reader`. The following example creates an authorization policy between the File service of the `KeyUserAccount` and the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} instance of the `KeyOwnerAccount`.

1. Create a JSON file with the following information for the authorization policies in your local Documents folder.
   ```json
   '{
      "description":"Reader and Delegator role for HPCS service instance",
      "resources": [{"attributes": [
            {"name": "KeyOwnerAccountID","value": "a/a1234567","operator": "stringEquals"},
            {"name":"Hyper-Protect-Crypto-Services","operator":"stringEquals","value":"hs-crypto"}]}],   
      "roles": [
         {"role_id":"crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:AuthorizationDelegator"},
         {"role_id":"crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Reader"}],
      "subjects": [
         {"name": "serviceName","value": "is"},
            {"name": "resourceType","value": "share"},
            {"name": "KeyUserAccountID","value": "a/a7654321>"}],
      "type":"authorization"
   }'
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Then, run the following CLI command with the JSON file to create the authorization policy.
   ```sh
   ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create --file ~/Documents/policy.json
   ```
   {: pre}
   
   The cross-account authorization is one-way and specific to key and service. When Account A authorizes their key to be used by Account B's file service, Account B can use Account A's CRK to encrypt Account B's shares. However, Account A cannot use Account B's root keys to encrypt Account A's shares.
   {: note}

## Creating authorization for cross-region replication from the CLI
{: #file-s2s-auth-replication-cli}

See the following example.

```sh 
$ ibmcloud iam authorization-policy-create is is Editor --source-resource-type share --target-resource-type share 
Creating authorization policy under account a1234567 as test.user@ibm.com...

## Creating authorization for cross-account encryption with Terraform
{: #file-s2s-xaccount-encryption-terraform}
{: terraform}

1. Terraform supports configuring two different accounts for IBM provider. The provider without an alias is considered the default provider. See the following example, where two IBM accounts are specified, and the second is given the alias `team_account`. That configuration is referred to as `ibm.team_account` later. 

   ```terraform 
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       ibm = {
         source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
         version = ">= 1.12.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "ibm" {
     ibmcloud_api_key = var.ibmcloud_api_key
     region           = var.region
     ibmcloud_timeout = var.ibmcloud_timeout
   }

   provider "ibm" {
     alias = "team_account"
     ibmcloud_api_key = var.ibmcloud_api_key_second_account
     region           = var.region
     ibmcloud_timeout = var.ibmcloud_timeout
   } 
   ```
   {: screen}

   For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [IBM Cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs#example-usage-of-provider){: external}.

1. To create the IAM authorization between the file share service from one account to the key management service in another account, use the resource `ibm_iam_authorization_policy`. The following example creates an authorization between the file service of one account and the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service of another account.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "policy1" {
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "accountId"
      value = data.ibm_iam_account_settings.iam.account_id
    }
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "serviceName"
      value = "is"
    }
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "resourceType"
      value = "share"
    }
    resource_attributes {
      name  = "accountId"
      value = data.ibm_iam_account_settings.iam.ibm.team_account_id
    }
    resource_attributes {
      name  = "Hyper-Protect-Crypto-Services"
      operator = "stringEquals"
      value = "hs-crypto"
    }
    roles   = ["Reader"]

   ```
   {: codeblock}

   The following example creates an authorization between the file service of one account and the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service of another account.

   ```Terraform
   resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "policy" {
       source_service_name = "is"
       source_resource_type = "share"
       source_service_account = "<fileshare-account-id>"
       target_service_name = "kms"   
       target_resource_instance_id = ibm_kms_key.key.instance_id
       roles               = ["Reader"]
       description         = "Authorization Policy" 
   }
   ```
   {: screen}

   This terraform resource must also include the provider alias (in our example, `ibm.team_account`) with the account `ibmcloud_api_key` where the encryption key is stored.

## Creating authorization for cross-region replication with Terraform
{: #file-s2s-auth-replication-terraform}
{: terraform}

Create an authorization policy between the file services in the different regions by using the `ibm_iam_authorization_policy` resource argument in your `main.tf` file.

```terraform 
resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "mypolicy" {
  source_service_name  = "is"
  source_resource_type = "share"
  target_service_name  = "is"
  target_resource_type = "share"
  roles                = ["Editor"]
}
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see the [Terraform documentation for authorization resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/iam_authorization_policy){: external}.

## Creating authorization for cross-account access with Terraform
{: #file-s2s-auth-xaccount-terraform}
{: terraform}

1. Terraform supports configuring two different accounts for IBM provider. The provider without an alias is considered the default provider. See the following example, where two IBM accounts are specified, and the second is given the alias `team_account`. That configuration must be referred to as `ibm.team_account` later. 

   ```terraform 
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       ibm = {
         source = "IBM-Cloud/ibm"
         version = ">= 1.12.0"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "ibm" {
     ibmcloud_api_key = var.ibmcloud_api_key
     region           = var.region
     ibmcloud_timeout = var.ibmcloud_timeout
   }

   provider "ibm" {
     alias = "team_account"
     ibmcloud_api_key = var.ibmcloud_api_key_second_account
     region           = var.region
     ibmcloud_timeout = var.ibmcloud_timeout
   } 
   ```
   {: screen}

   For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [IBM Cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs#example-usage-of-provider){: external}.

1. To create the IAM authorization between the file share service from one account to the file share service in a different account, use the resource `ibm_iam_authorization_policy`. The following example creates an authorization between the file services of two accounts.

   ```Terraform
   resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "policy" {
       source_service_name = "is"
       source_resource_type = "share"
       source_service_account = "<ShareOwner-Account-id>"
       target_service_name = "is"   
       target_resource_type = "share"
       target_service_account = "<Accessor-Account-id>"
       roles               = ["ShareBroker"]
       description         = "Authorization Policy" 
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Or

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_iam_authorization_policy" "policy1" {
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "accountId"
      value = data.ibm_iam_account_settings.iam.account_id
    }
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "serviceName"
      value = "is"
    }
    subject_attributes {
      name  = "resourceType"
      value = "share"
    }
    resource_attributes {
      name  = "shareId"
      operator = "stringEquals"
      value = data.ibm_share_id
    }
    resource_attributes {
      name  = "serviceName"
      operator = "stringEquals"
      value = "is"
    }
    resource_attributes {
      name  = "volumeId"
      operator = "stringExists"
      value = "true"
    }
    roles   = ["ShareBroker"]
    }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   This terraform resource must also include the provider alias (in our example, `ibm.team_account`) with the account `ibmcloud_api_key` where the origin share is.

   For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_iam_authorization_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/iam_authorization_policy#authorization-policy-between-two-specific-services){: external}.
