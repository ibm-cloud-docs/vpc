# Replication failover
{: #file-storage-failover}

A failover to the replica file share keeps your data available if your source file share becomes unavailable. The failover switches the replication relationship so that the replica file share becomes the source file share and the source share becomes the read-only replica file share.
{: shortdesc}

## Replication failover concepts
{: #fs-failover-concepts}

When you create a replica file share, the replica pulls data from the source file share based on a replication schedule. The data on the replica file share is set to read-only. Failover switches the replication relationship. The read-only replica file share becomes the read/write source file share and the original share becomes read-only. You can now mount the active file share and manage it as a regular file share. 

When you initiate a failover, you can choose what happens if the failover operation fails or times out. The default timeout is 5 minutes.

* If you decide to keep the replication relationship, the system "falls back" to the source share. Even though the operation failed, the system attempts to replicate data again at the next scheduled time. This option can be used when the primary site is scheduled for [routine maintenance](#fs-failover-maintenance). You can fall back to the original share when the maintenance is complete and the site is stable again. Replication can resume.

* If you decide to remove the replication relationship, the system splits the two file shares apart, and they become independent read/write file shares. This option can be used for failover in a [disaster recovery](#fs-failover-dr) situation when it's more important to start your application up as quickly as possible. So you can continue normal operations on the replica site, while the future of the original site is uncertain. 

A failover operation or a replica split cannot occur when another operation is being performed on the source or replica file share (for example, the file share size is being expanded). The split or failover operation continues to pend until the other operation completes.
{: important}

The [failover status](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-vpc-monitoring) shows `failover_pending` while the operation is underway, or while the service is waiting for another operation to complete.

### Failover for routine maintenance
{: #fs-failover-maintenance}

Use a failover for routine maintenance on the primary site or when the site is having problems. The process works as follows.

* The source file share in zone A refuses all read and write operations. Then, the system attempts to pull a final copy of the share's data to the replica share in zone B.
* The data is copied to the replica file share, which becomes read/write and is considered the new source site. (The replication relationship is reversed.)
* The service attempts to replicate data from the active source in zone B to the original share in zone A as scheduled. If the data transfer fails, the system attempts again at the next scheduled replication time.
* You can fall back to the original share when the maintenance is done and the site is stable again. Or, you can keep the replica share as your source share.

### Failover in a disaster recovery situation
{: #fs-failover-dr}

Failover is also an option for disaster recovery. If the original site is confirmed to be unavailable and you need your application started as soon as possible on the replica location, opt to remove the replication relationship. Removing the replication relationship is an option for the fallback policy when you initiate the failover. Failover for disaster recovery works in the following way:

* The file share at the source site refuses all read and write operations and the system attempts to pull a final copy of the share's data to the replica file share.
* When the data-pull times out and fails, the file service breaks the replication relationship. The replica file share becomes read/write and operates as an independent file share. It can be mounted and managed as a normal file share.
*  Replication relationship cannot be reestablished. However, you can set up a new replica on the original site if and when the site becomes operational again.

Due to the nature of the disaster recovery failover, you might find that the latest data set did not get copied over. In that case, you probably need to reconcile the state of your application manually when the source file share is available again. If the source file share zone becomes available again, data is available from the replica share to reconcile from the time of the incident to the recovery point.

## Restrictions
{: #fs-failover-restrictions}

These restrictions apply when you perform a failover.

* The default timeout for a successful failover is 5 minutes. You can modify this value when you [initiate the failover](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-failover#fs-failover-procedure-ui) options.

* A failover remains pending when other operations are being performed on the source file share, such as expanding the share size. When the operation completes, the failover resumes.

## Initiating a failover in the console
{: #fs-failover-procedure-ui}
{: ui}

1. Navigate to the list of all file shares. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../icons/vpc.svg) **> Storage > File storage shares**.

2. Click the name of a replica file share to open its details page.

3. From the **Actions** menu ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions"), select **Perform failover**. Before the failover, a final sync of the files is performed to ensure that the failover share has the latest content. When the failover completes, the replica file share becomes the new source file share. The former source share becomes the new read-only replica share.

4. To set a timeout value, check the box under **Timeout (optional)** and specify a time value. This value specifies an absolute time limit for the failover to complete. Set a timeout based on how long you can have your file share offline.

5. Under **Failover policy**, if the failover operation does not succeed or times out, choose to keep the replication relationship or change it:
    * Keep replication relationship - No changes are made to the replica file share or source file share.
    * Remove replication relationship - This action creates two separate read/write file shares. Because the relationship is broken, changes to one file share do not affect the other.

    After you break the relationship, it can't be reestablished.
    {: note}

6. Click **Perform failover**. Messages display that indicate that the failover was requested and is being performed.

The file share details page is updated, and the replication relationship shows the replica file share as the new source file share.

## Initiating a failover from the CLI
{: #fs-failover-procedure-cli}
{: cli}

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
{: requirement}

1. Locate the replica file share that you want to fail over to by listing all file shares in the region with the `ibmcloud is shares` command

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud is shares
   Listing shares in all resource groups and region us-south under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
   ID                                          Name                    Lifecycle state   Zone         Profile   Size(GB)   Resource group   Replication role   Accessor binding role   Snapshot count   Snapshot size   
   r006-a8d6af48-0c97-4c6b-bab1-fbefdc1e1e03   my-file-share           stable            us-south-2   dp2       10         defaults         none               none                    0                0

   r006-455b601c-8fc1-4476-8771-4708c49c8ef7   my-replica-share-dal-1  stable            us-south-1   dp2       10         defaults         replica            none                    0                0   
   r006-4dadac27-cd17-42df-a5fe-1388705d33e0   my-source-share-dal-2   stable            us-south-2   dp2       10         defaults         source             none                    0                0   
    
   ```
   {: screen}

1. Run the `ibmcloud is share-replica-failover` command and specify the `fallback-policy` property. You can specify `fail` or `split` for this property. 

   * The following example specifies `fail` for the `fallback-policy` property. If the failover operation fails or the timeout is reached, the failover operation is unsuccessful. The source share remains active and the replication resumes as scheduled.

   ```sh
   $ ibmcloud is share-replica-failover r006-a60bfa90-a893-40ad-be34-28ab51a963f9 --fallback-policy fail
   The file share r006-a60bfa90-a893-40ad-be34-28ab51a963f9 failover request was accepted under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
   The file share failover request was accepted.
   ```
   {: screen}

   * The following example specifies `split` for the `fallback-policy` property. If the failover operation fails, the replica share is split from the source file share. If the failover fails, the result is two independent read/write file shares.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud is share-replica-failover my-source-share-dal-2 --fallback-policy split
   The file share r006-4dadac27-cd17-42df-a5fe-1388705d33e0 failover request was accepted under account Test Account as user test.user@ibm.com...
   The file share failover request was accepted.
   ```
   {: screen}

For more information about the command options, see [`ibmcloud is share-replica-failover`](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#share-replica-failover).

## Initiating a failover with the API
{: #fs-failover-procedure-api}
{: api}

Make a `POST /shares/{share_id}/failover` request and specify the `timeout` and `fallback_policy` properties. The minimum timeout is 300 seconds and the maximum 3600 seconds. This request initiates a failover of a source file share to the replica share, which is specified by the replica file share ID.

The `fallback_policy` property can have the values: `split` or `fail`. When `fail` is specified, if the failover operation fails or the timeout is reached, the failover operation is unsuccessful. The replication relationship remains unchanged.

If you specify `split` for the `fallback_policy` property, the replica share is split from the source share whenever a failover operation fails. The result is two independent read/write file shares. In this case, because the final file synchronization did not complete, the replica share might not contain all the data of the source file share. Use this option for disaster recovery, when the source file share is known to be unreachable.

If the `fallback_policy` property is not specified in the request, the system defaults to `split` when the failover operation fails.

This example specifies `fail` for the `fallback_policy` property. The `timeout` property is optional. You can use the default timeout.

```sh
curl -X POST \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/shares/$replica_id?/failover?version=2023-08-08"\
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"\
-d '{
     "fallback_policy": "fail",
      "timeout": 600
    }'
```
{: pre}

A successful response indicates that the file share failover request was accepted.

You can use the API to verify that the replication failover succeeded, is pending, or failed. Make a `GET /shares/{replica_id}` call. Look at the `latest_job` property. For more information, see [Verify replication with the API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-manage-replication&interface=api#fs-verify-replica-api).
{: note}

## Initiating a failover with Terraform
{: #fs-failover-procedure-terraform}
{: terraform}

When a failover is performed, the replica share becomes the source, and the source share becomes the replica. The terraform configuration needs to be modified to match this change. The `fallback_policy` defines the action to take if the failover request is accepted but cannot be performed or times out. Accepted values are `split` or `fail`. If you specify `split` and the failover is unsuccessful, the system breaks the replication relationship, and the two file shares become independent of each other.

```Terraform
resource "ibm_is_share_replica_operations" "test" {
  share_replica = ibm_is_share.replica.id
  fallback_policy = "split"
  timeout = 500
}
```
{: codeblock}
