# Getting started with Catalog images on VPC
{: #getting-started-images-on-vpc-catalog}

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} on x86 architecture, you can select from the supported virtual server operating system stock images, the virtual server operating system bundle stock image, or a custom image that you import from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}}. The image that you select determines the operating system that is provisioned for your instance. If the image you select is a virtual server operating system bundle stock image, the software that is part of that bundle is also included in your instance.
{: shortdesc}

In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Images**.

There are 3 different types of images for VPC.
* [Custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images) (includes [Image from volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc))
* [Stock images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-images-on-vpc-stock&interface=api)
* Catalog images

## Images on VPC - Catalog images
{: #images-on-vpc-catalog-images}

If you plan to share or publish a custom image to other accounts within your enterprise, you need to create a private catalog. A private catalog provides a way for you to manage access to products for multiple accounts while those accounts are within the same enterprise. You can share any existing x86 virtual server custom image with a private catalog, except for an encrypted image. For more information about these limitations, see [VPC considerations when using custom images in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=api).

When you select a catalog image, you need to make sure that you are aware of any associated billing plans.

Catalog images are billed in one of the following ways.

* Free trial
* Usage-based
* BYOL

Images that are shared through a private catalog are still offered without billing.
{: note}

Any private catalog images available to your VPC can be found in**Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Images > Catalog images**

To create a virtual server using a private catalog image, see one of the following:
