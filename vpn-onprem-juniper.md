# Connecting a Juniper vSRX peer
{: #juniper-vsrx-config}

You can use IBM Cloud VPN for VPC to securely connect your VPC to an on-prem network through a VPN tunnel. This topic provides guidance on how to configure your Juniper VPN gateway to connect to VPN for VPC.
{: shortdesc}

If Juniper vSRX requires Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) to be enabled in Phase 2, you need to create a custom IPsec policy to replace the default policy for the VPN in your VPC. For more information, see [Creating a custom IPsec policy for Juniper vSRX](#custom-ipsec-policy-with-vsrx).
{: important}

These instructions are based on Juniper vSRX, JUNOS Software Release [23.2R1-S1 Standard 23.2.1.1].
{: note}

Read [Known issues for VPN gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-limitations) before you continue to connect to your on-premises peer.
{: tip}

When the Juniper VPN receives a connection request from VPN for VPC, Juniper uses IPsec Phase 1 parameters to establish a secure connection and authenticate the VPN for VPC gateway. Then, if the security policy permits the connection, the Juniper VPN establishes the tunnel using IPsec Phase 2 parameters and applies the IPsec security policy. Key management, authentication, and security services are negotiated dynamically through the IKE protocol.

To support these functions, you must do the following on the Juniper vSRX unit:

* Define the Phase 1 parameters that the Juniper vSRX VPN requires to authenticate the remote peer and establish a secure connection.
* Define the Phase 2 parameters that the Juniper vSRX VPN requires to create a VPN tunnel with {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}}.

General configuration steps are as follows.

1. Choose `IKEv2` in Phase 1.
1. Set up policy-based mode.
1. Enable `DH-group 19` in the Phase 1 proposal.
1. Set `lifetime = 36000` in the Phase 1 proposal.
1. Enable PFS in the Phase 2 proposal.
1. Set `lifetime = 10800` in the Phase 2 proposal.
1. Input your peer and subnet information in the Phase 2 proposal.
1. Allow UDP 500 traffic on the external interface.

## Policy-based configuration for Juniper vSRX
{: #policy-based-setup-vsrx}

Here's an example of how to set up security.

   {: codeblock}

1. Configure TCP MSS clamping on vSRX to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.

   ```sh
   set security flow tcp-mss ipsec-vpn mss 1360
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. After the configuration file finishes running, you can check the connection status from the CLI using the following command:

   ```sh
   run show security ipsec security-associations
   ```

## Creating a custom IPsec policy for Juniper vSRX
{: #custom-ipsec-policy-with-vsrx}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} disables PFS in Phase 2. If Juniper vSRX requires PFS to be enabled in Phase 2, you need to create a custom IPsec policy to replace the default policy for the VPN in your VPC.

To use a custom IPsec policy in {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}}, follow these steps:

1. On the {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_short}} page in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, select the **IPsec policies** tab.

1. Click **New IPsec policy** and specify the following values:

   * For the **Authentication** field, select **sha256**.
   * For the **Encryption** field, select **aes256**.
   * Select the **PFS** option.
   * For the **DH Group** field, select **19**.
   * For the **Key lifetime** field, specify **3600**.

1. When you create the VPN connection in your VPC, select this custom IPsec policy.

## Setting up a route-based configuration for Juniper vSRX
{: #route-based-setup-vsrx}

The following configuration shows how to set up two route-based tunnels between the Juniper vSRX VPN and VPN for VPC using a weighted preference for two tunnels.

The VPN for VPC gateway should have a connection where the peer address is the vSRX public IP.
{: note}

Here's an example to set the vSRX configuration.

1. Configure an IKE proposal for a route-based VPN:

   ```sh
   set security ike proposal ibm-vpc-ike-proposal authentication-method pre-shared-keys
   set security ike proposal ibm-vpc-ike-proposal dh-group group19
   set security ike proposal ibm-vpc-ike-proposal authentication-algorithm sha-256
   set security ike proposal ibm-vpc-ike-proposal encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
   set security ike proposal ibm-vpc-ike-proposal lifetime-seconds 86400
   set security ike policy ibm-vpc-ike-policy mode main
   set security ike policy ibm-vpc-ike-policy proposals ibm-vpc-ike-proposal
   set security ike policy ibm-vpc-ike-policy pre-shared-key ascii-text <your-psk>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Configure an IKE gateway to the primary tunnel:

   ```sh
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary ike-policy ibm-vpc-ike-policy
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary address <VPN for VPC Gateway Small Public IP>
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary dead-peer-detection interval 2
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary dead-peer-detection threshold 3
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary local-identity inet <vSRX Public IP>
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary external-interface ae1.0
   set security ike gateway ibm-vpc-gateway-primary version v2-only
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Configure an IPsec proposal for a route-based VPN:

   ```sh
   set security ipsec proposal ibm-vpc-ipsec-proposal protocol esp
   set security ipsec proposal ibm-vpc-ipsec-proposal authentication-algorithm hmac-sha-256-128
   set security ipsec proposal ibm-vpc-ipsec-proposal encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
   set security ipsec proposal ibm-vpc-ipsec-proposal lifetime-seconds 3600
   set security ipsec policy ibm-vpc-ipsec-policy perfect-forward-secrecy keys group19
   set security ipsec policy ibm-vpc-ipsec-policy proposals ibm-vpc-ipsec-proposal
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Configure a VTI and VPN connection to the primary VPN tunnel:

   Create the virtual tunnel interface and configure the link-local address (`169.254.0.2/30`) on the interface. Be careful to choose the link-local address and make sure that it is not overlapping with other addresses on the device. There are two available IP addresses (`169.254.0.1` and `169.254.0.2`) in a subnet with a 30-bit netmask. The first IP address `169.254.0.1` is used as the IBM VPN gateway VTI address; the second, `169.254.0.2`, is used as the vSRX VTI address. If you have more than one VTI on the vSRX, you can choose another link-local subnet, such as `169.254.0.4/30`, `169.254.0.8/30`, and so on.

   You do not need to configure `169.254.0.1` on the IBM VPN gateway. It is referenced only when you configure the routes on the vSRX.
   {: note}

   ```sh
   set interfaces st0 unit 2 multipoint
