{: caption="Actions for managing reservations for virtual servers" caption-side="bottom"}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-managing-reserved-vpc}

You must provision your reservation before you attach virtual servers. For more information, see [Provisioning reservations for virtual servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-provisioning-reserved-capacity-vpc).

If you are not the account administrator, your user account must include the **Manage reserved capacities** permission. For more information about updating permissions, see [Managing IAM access for VPC Infrastructure Services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started).

## Managing a reservation with the UI
{: #managing-reservation-ui-vpc}
{: ui}

You can use the UI to manage your reservation and the serversnthat are attached.

### Attaching a virtual server instance to your reservation with the UI
{: #attach-vsi-reservation-ui-vpc}
{: ui}

You can attach a virtual server to a reservation.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click **Navigation Menu** icon ![the menu icon ](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Reservations**.
1. Select a reservation in the Reservation details page.
1. From the virtual servers list, click **Actions** > **Attach**.
1. Select the server that you want to attach to the reservation and click **Attach**.

### Detaching a server from reservation with the UI
{: #removing-adding-server-reservation-ui-vpc}
{: ui}

You can detach a virtual server from your reservation.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click **Navigation Menu** icon ![the menu icon ](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Reservations**.
1. From your virtual server list or in the Reservation details page, click the server that you want to detach and then click **Actions** > **Detach**.
1. To confirm, click **Detach**.

If the instance is stopped and started, even though pointing to an expired reservation, it is allowed to start and is billed at pay-go prices.
{: note}

### Special considerations for deleting a reservation
{: #special-considerations-deleting-reservation-vpc}

You can delete an `inactive` reservation and you can patch the following fields.

   * affinity_policy
   * capacity.total
   * committed_use.expiration_policy
   * committed_use.term
   * name
   * profile

If you want to change any other fields, you need to delete the reservation and re-create it.

However, after a reservation is activated and is `active`, many aspects of the reservation are permanent for the lifetime of the reservation. Make sure that you review the reservation before you activate it to make sure that the configuration is correct. The only fields that can be patched for an `active` reservation are `name` and `committed_use.expiration_policy`.

### Deleting a reservation with the UI
{: #deleting-reservation-ui-vpc}

## Managing reservation with the API
{: #managing-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

To manage a reservation by using the application programming interface (API), you need an IAM role that includes the following actions. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for VPC Infrastructure Services](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-iam-getting-started).

   - is.reservation.reservation.list
   - is.reservation.reservation.read
   - is.reservation.reservation.create
   - is.reservation.reservation.delete
   - is.reservation.reservation.read
   - is.reservation.reservation.update

### Listing all reservations
{: #list-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

You can list all of the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} reservations in your region by using the application programming interface (API). To list all reservations by using the API, use [List all images](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-reservations).

Specify a `GET /reservations` request to list all of the reservations. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/reservations?version=2024-01-27&generation=2" -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

The reservations are sorted first by their `create_at` property value. The newest reservations are listed first. If reservations have identical `created_at` property values, they are then sorted by their `name` property values. The list of reservations defaults to 50 reservations, but you can increase this amount up to 100.

You can filter the list further with the following property values.

* `name`
* `resource_group.id`
* `zone.name`

### Deleting a reservation
{: #delete-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

You can delete an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} reservation in your region by using the application programming interface (API). To delete a reservation by using the API, use [Delete a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#delete-reservation).

Specify a `DELETE /reservation` request to delete a reservation. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X DELETE "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/reservations/$id?version=2024-01-27&generation=2" - H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

### Retrieving a reservation
{: #retrieve-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

You can retrieve a specific {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} reservation in your region by using the application programming interface (API). To retrieve a specific reservation by using the API, use [Retrieve a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#get-reservation).

Specify a `GET /reservation/{id}` request to retrieve a specific reservation where `id` is the reservation identifier of the reservation you are retrieving. The identifier is in the URL. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/reservations/$id?version=2024-01-27&generation=2" - H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

### Updating a reservation
{: #update-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

You update a specific {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} reservation in your region by using the application programming interface (API). To update a specific reservation by using the API, use [Update a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#update-reservation).

Specify a `PATCH /reservations/{id}` request to update a specific reservation where `id` is the reservation identifier of the reservation you are retrieving. The identifier is in the URL. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X PATCH "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/reservations/$id?version=2024-01-27&generation=2" -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token" -d '{
      "committed_use": {
        "expiration_policy": "release"
      }
    }'
```
{: pre}

### Activating a reservation
{: #activate-reservation-api-vpc}
{: api}

You can activate a specific {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} reservation in your region by using the application programming interface (API). To activate a specific reservation by using the API, use [Activate a reservation](/apidocs/vpc/latest#activate-reservation).

Specify a `POST /reservations/{id}/activate` request to update a specific reservation where `id` is the reservation identifier of the reservation you are retrieving. The identifier is in the URL. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X POST "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/reservations/$id/activate?version=2024-01-27&generation=2" -H "Authorization: Bearer $iam_token"
```
{: pre}
