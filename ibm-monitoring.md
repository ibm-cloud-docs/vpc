## View a specific monitoring dashboard
{: #view-specific-dashboard}

1. To view a specific dashboard on the monitoring, first go to the [monitoring UI](/observe/monitoring). For more information, see [Navigating to the web UI](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-launch) for Monitoring.
2. In the Monitoring UI, select the instance that you want to view monitoring metrics for. Then, select Open Dashboard.
3. Select the Dashboards tile, the Dashboards menu expands.
4. Under DASHBOARD TEMPLATES, expand the `IBM` tab to select the dashboard you want to access. The names of available dashboards are detailed in Table 1.

## Limitations of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_vpc_short}} monitoring
{: #fs-metrics-limitations}

The system queries file share information hourly. When you create a file share or increase its capacity, it can take up to an hour for this information to appear on the monitoring dashboards.
