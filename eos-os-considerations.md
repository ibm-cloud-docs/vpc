# End of support operating system considerations
{: #eos-os-considerations-intro}

If you use an operating system (OS) that is at or past its end-of-support (EOS) date, security and stability risks are possible. The vendor no longer provides updates or security fixes for deprecated OS versions.
{: short-desc}

Follow the guidance from your OS vendor on when to upgrade. {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} doesn't require you to migrate your active instances to a supported OS, but you assume the risks that are associated with using an outdated OS. Unsupported operating systems don't receive security updates or fixes and can't be used to deploy new instances. Plan to modernize the instances' OS before the EOS date. For more information, see [Lifecycle for guest operating systems](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-guest-os-lifecycle).

## Available options when you modernize your OS
{: #options-when-upgrading-os}

When you plan for an OS EOS, keep the following information in mind:

* You can use the assistance of an IBM partner.
* You can upgrade your instances on your own.
* Continue with your EOS OS (at your own risk).

### Wanclouds partnership
{: #partner}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} has a partnership with Wanclouds. Contact [Wanclouds](https://wanclouds.net/ibm/request){: external} for more information.

### Upgrade your OS on your own
{: #upgrading-your-os}

If you decide to upgrade your OS yourself, you can use one of two options:

- Side-by-side upgrade (migration).
- In-place upgrade.

   Make sure that you follow your OS vendor's guidance when you upgrade your OS.
   {: important}

#### Side-by-side upgrades
{: #side-by-side-upgrade}

When you upgrade with the side-by-side method, you create a new instance with the new OS version. You must migrate data and applications from the old instance after the new instance is created.

Extra charges are incurred if both instances are active in a side-by-side upgrade.
{: important}

**Best practices for side-by-side upgrades:**

- Read your OS vendor's documentation to understand the differences between the old and new OS versions.
- Consider the instance downtime that is required for the upgrade.
- Create a backup of your original instance. For more information, see [Best practices for backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices&interface=ui).
- Test that the new instance with the updated OS works properly before you migrate data or delete your original instance.

#### In-place upgrade
{: #in-place-upgrade}

When you use the in-place upgrade method, you can use your previous configurations and data when you upgrade your OS. Follow your OS's vendor documentation if you choose the in-place upgrade method. Refer to the section in this document for your OS for specific considerations.

If you encounter problems during the in-place upgrade process, IBM can't provide support. For more information, see your OS vendor's documentation.
{: note}

**Best practices for in-place upgrades:**

- Review your OS vendor's documentation to identify process steps and associated risks.
- Consider the instance downtime that is required for the upgrade. Workloads can be unavailable when you upgrade.
- Before you upgrade your OS, download and install the latest software updates for your OS.
- Create a backup of your original instance. For more information, see [Best practices for backups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backups-vpc-best-practices&interface=ui).
- Upgrade in a test environment before you upgrade in a production environment.
- Test that the new instance with the updated OS works properly before you delete your original instance.
- After the in-place upgrade is complete, create a full backup of the upgraded instance, not an incremental backup.

### Continue with your EOS OS at your own risk
{: #continue-using-your-eos-os-vpc}

If you choose to continue with an EOS OS, consider the following information:

- The EOS OS can't receive security updates.
- The OS isn't tested for hardware, drivers, or firmware.
- Support isn't available for performance or operational issues on the server with an EOS OS.
   - Vendor support is unavailable for an EOS OS.
   - EOS operating systems are not supported by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Technical Support.
 
## End of Support (EOS) announcements
{: #bm-classic-eos-announcements}

End of Support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. The EOS date is also the effective date that the product ceases to exist (is deprecated) and can no longer be ordered or purchased.
