Customer-defined AS Path Prepends support
:    You can now influence BGP route selection in VPC networking using AS path length. Previously, VPC networking ignored AS path length when choosing the best route, which often required you to use a Transit Gateway between Direct Link and VPC in certain topologies to achieve specific routing behavior. Now, you can influence routing by deprioritizing paths, ideal for managing primary and backup Direct Link connections or configuring failover in hybrid and multicloud environments. For more information, see [Using AS Prepends with VPC connections](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-planning-considerations#as-prepends-routes).

VPC Metadata on bare metal servers (GA)
:   The VPC Metadata service is available on bare metal servers. It is a free service that provides a REST API that you invoke within a bare metal server to get bare metal server identity tokens and bare metal server identity certificates. Access to the API is unavailable from outside the bare metal server. The service is disabled by default. You can optionally use bare metal server identity tokens to get IAM access tokens for access to all IAM-enabled services. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} (VPC) Metadata on bare metal servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bare-metal-server-metadata-about).

   For information about the REST API, see the following:

   - [API change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-api-change-log#26-august-2025)
   - [API Identity change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-identity-api-change-log#26-august-2025-identity)
   - [API Metadata change log](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-metadata-api-change-log#26-august-2025-metadata)
   - [VPC Identity API](/apidocs/vpc-identity)

   If you currently use the `/instance_identity/v1/token` method and want to adopt the API release version 2025-08-26 or later, review the changes that are described in the migration guidance: [Updating to the `2025-08-26` version of the VPC Identity API](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-#2025-08-26-migration-metadata-identity#changed-paths-metadata-identity).

Encryption-in-transit support for bare metal servers

Secure boot for Virtual Servers for VPC (GA)
:   Secure boot is now generally available. Secure boot is a security standard that makes sure that your server starts with trusted software by verifying the digital signatures for all code in the boot process. When a server starts in secure boot mode, the firmware checks the signature of the boot software, including UEFI firmware drivers, EFI applications, and the operating system. If the signatures are valid, the server boots, and the firmware grants control to the operating system. Which means that secure boot helps prevent malicious software from loading when your server starts.

Protocol state filtering on virtual network interfaces can be updated
:   Protocol state filtering works well if the packet forwarding path and the return path are the same, and if the packet forwarding path is never changed. However, the VPC routing table supports two-way ECMP routes. When a two-way ECMP route is configured, the forward path might differ from the return path and protocol state filtering can cause legitimate packets to drop. You can now disable protocol state filtering when intermittent routing issues occur. For more information, see [Protocol state filtering mode](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about#protocol-state-filtering).

Third-party image billing and metering (GA)

Security group support for secondary IP addresses (GA)
:   You can now attach both primary and secondary IP addresses to a security group to refine the binding of security groups rules to a particular port IP instead of all IP addresses belonging to the port. Also, security group rules now support both source and destination on ingress and egress rules. This allows customers with multiple, secondary private IP addresses associated with a single vNIC to have the ability to apply security group rules to source and destination IP addresses, thus enabling finer granularity in security rules. This enhancement provides the capability to secure the primary IP different from the secondary IP addresses, and also applies to VIP prefixes (custom routes) used with a vNIC with IP spoofing disabled.

Confidential computing with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) for Virtual Servers for VPC (select availability)
:   Confidential computing with Intel&reg; Software Guard Extensions (SGX) protects your data through hardware-based server security by using isolated memory regions that are known as encrypted enclaves. This hardware-based computation helps protect your data from disclosure or modification. Which means that your sensitive data is encrypted while it is in virtual server instance memory by allowing applications to run in private memory space. To use SGX, you must install the SGX drivers and platform software on SGX-capable worker nodes. Then, design your app to run in an SGX environment. Confidential computing with Intel SGX for VPC is available only in US-South (Dallas) region. For more information, see [Confidential computing with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) for Virtual Servers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc).

Advertise routes to transit gateway and direct link for ingress routing integration
:   VPN for VPC now allows route advertisement so that on-prem CIDR blocks can be advertised to other VPCs without creating address prefixes. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-advertise-routes-s2s). For more information about migrating to advertised routes, see [VPN for VPC migration to advertise routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-advertise-routes-s2s#migrate-to-advertise-routes-s2s).

   Client VPN for VPC now allows route advertisement so that on-prem CIDR blocks can be advertised to other VPCs by creating a `deliver` action instead of a `translate` action. For more information, see [Configuring route propagation for VPN servers](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation). For more information about migrating to advertised routes, see [Client VPN for VPC migration to advertise routes](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-route-propagation#advertise-routes-c2s).

VPN for VPC: Configurable IKE identity and peer FQDN
:    When you configure a VPN gateway connection, you can now specify a peer FQDN as the peer gateway address. This allows you to use a dynamic public IP on the peer gateway. The VPN gateway connection also supports configuring the IKE identity with supported types: IPv4 address, FQDN, Hostname, and Key ID. The default local IKE identity value is the public IP address of the active member of the VPN gateway while the default peer IKE identity value is the peer gateway address or FQDN.

   You can control which side initiates IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes on the VPN gateway connection. By default, the VPN gateway initiates IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes while also accepting IKE protocol negotiations or rekeying from the peer gateway. You can disable the VPN gateway from initiating IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes, and instead accept only the peer gateway to initiate IKE protocol negotiations and rekeying processes by setting Establish mode to `Peer only`. This enhancement enables you to connect the peer gateway behind a firewall and avoid conflicts in IKE negotiations. For more information, see [Creating a VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-gateway&interface=ui).

Ubuntu 24.04 now available to provision virtual servers
:    Support for the Ubuntu 24.04 release, codenamed "Noble Numbat", is now available. You can use the *ibm-ubuntu-24-04-minimal-amd64-1* stock image to provision virtual server instances. After the virtual server is created, you can also use it as a starting point for a custom image by creating an image from the boot volume of the virtual server.

Virtual Network Interfaces for VPC
:   A new feature is generally available in the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) service that expands the support for [virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about). The following features are available.
   - Virtual network interfaces have an independent lifecycle, which means that when you delete a resource to which the virtual network interface is attached, the virtual network interface persists and retains its IP address.
   - New instances and bare metal servers can be created with virtual network interfaces attached to new child resources called network attachments.
   - Virtual network interfaces support secondary IP addresses.
   - For compatibility with existing clients, instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces include a read-only representation of their network attachments and virtual network interfaces as legacy network interface child resources.
   - For instances and bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces, the IAM permissions for options to allow IP spoofing or disable infrastructure NAT are managed on their attached virtual network interfaces.
   - Flow log collectors can target instance network attachments and virtual network interfaces.

   You can choose to defer access to this feature through [IBM Support](/unifiedsupport/supportcenter). Users in an account that has deferred access will not be able to create instances or bare metal servers with virtual network interfaces. If you need more time to assess, remediate, and test changes for virtual network interfaces, request deferral for your production accounts while you complete the mitigations using your test accounts.

IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11` updates
:  For the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11`, new certificates are available.
   - Attestation certificate
   - Encryption certificate
   - Intermediate certificate

   Support for customer-managed keys through integration with Hyper Protect Crypto Services
   - **Without** the feature, the data volume that you attach to your instance is encrypted automatically with a LUKS passphrase generated by using the **two** seeds from the `workload` - `volumes` and `env` - `volumes` sections of the contract. **Starting from the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-11`**, Hyper Protect Virtual Servers support integration with the key management service (KMS) Hyper Protect Crypto Services. You can enable the integration by providing KMS configurations in the contract. Your Hyper Protect Virtual Server instance calls Hyper Protect Crypto Services to generate a random value as the third seed and wrap it with your root key. The wrapped seed is stored in the metadata partition of your data volume. The LUKS passphrase is generated by using **three** seeds - the seed in the metadata partition (unwrapped first) and the two seeds from the contract. For more information about how the integration works and detailed instructions, see [Securing your data](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-hyper-protect-virtual-server-mng-data).

   Deploying multiple containers
   - In the `workload` section of the contract, you can define the workload via Pod descriptors. Each pod can contain one or more container definitions. Previously, only one container described by docker compose was supported. For more information about using Pod descriptors, see the [`play` subsection](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-contract_se#hpcr_contract_play). Container images described by Pod descriptors can be [validated by RedHat Simple Signing](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-contract_se#container-image-by-pod-descriptors).

   Changes to the attestation document
   - In the attestation document **se-checksums.txt**, `user-data.decrypted` is removed, and `Machine Type/Plant/Serial` (the information required to identify the host machine) is added. For more information, see [Attestation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-attestation).

Instance group integration with network load balancers (GA)
:  Network Load Balancer for VPC is now integrated with instance groups to improve pool member scaling. When you create or update an instance group for auto scaling, you can now specify the Network Load Balancer pool for the instance group to manage. For more information see [Creating an instance group for auto scaling](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group).

Access control modes and granular authorization for File Storage for VPC file shares (beta release)
:   For users with accounts that have access to file shares, you can now specify an access control mode to either restrict mounting a file share to a specific virtual server instance in the VPC or allow VPC-wide file share mounting. File share mount targets that were created before `20-June-2023` have a default of VPC-wide file share mounting. File shares that are created after that date can specify security group access control mode to restrict access to a specific instance. For this option, file shares must be based on the [`dp2` profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui#dp2-profile). From the UI, CLI, or API, you set the access control mode when you create or update file shares, and can see the setting when you list file shares and in the file share details. When you create a mount target for a file share with security group access mode, you can specify a [virtual network interface](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about) to be created and attached to the mount target with a [security group](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-security-groups). For the virtual network interface, you can specify an existing reserved IP, or specify a subnet and allow the system to assign an IP address. When the mount target is attached and the share is mounted, the virtual network interface performs security group policy check to ensure only authorized virtual server instances can communicate with the share. For more information, see [Mount targets for file shares](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-about#fs-share-mount-targets).

Data encryption in transit for file shares (beta release)
:  For users with accounts that have access to file shares, you can enable secure end-to-end encryption of your data when using security group based access control on file shares and mount targets with virtual network interfaces. The traffic between the authorized virtual server and the file share can optionally be IPsec encapsulated by the client. By using an Internet Security Protocol (IPsec), you can establish an encrypted mount connection between the virtual server instance and a file share with the `dp2` profile. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} file service provides a [mount helper utility](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-fs-mount-helper-utility) to automate the complex tasks of configuring and maintaining the connection. For more information, see [Encryption in transit - Securing mount connections between file share and host](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-vpc-eit).

Virtual network interface (beta release)
:  Virtual network interfaces are now available in a beta release for use with file share mount targets. For more information see [About virtual network interfaces](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vni-about).

VPC routing table authorizations
:   You can use the new VPC routing table authorizations to allow users to administer VPC routing tables but not allow them to administer the broader VPC. Routing table operations were updated to check for these new authorizations, instead of the broader VPC authorizations. The VPC Administrator, Editor, Operator, and Viewer IAM access roles were updated so that users with those roles function as before. However, custom roles that require access to routing tables must be updated.

By default, a boot volume that was created as part of provisioning a virtual server instance is deleted when the instance is deleted. You can control this behavior when you create or update an instance. For more information, see [Creating virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-virtual-servers&interface=ui), and [Managing virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-virtual-server-instances&interface=ui).

Designating VPC route priority
:   When multiple VPC routes exist for a destination, you can now control the priority of these routes (from `0` to `4`). New and existing routes, which are created without a priority value, are automatically set to the default priority (`2`). Smaller values have higher priority. For more information, see [Determining route preference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cr-determining-route-preference).

   The route priority is considered on identical destinations only.

IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-9` updates
:  For the IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime image version `ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-1-0-s390x-9`, new certificates are available.
   - Attestation certificate
   - Encryption certificate
   - Intermediate certificate

   Two partitions in new data volume
   - For new {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} instances, the data volume is partitioned into two parts. The first partition (100Mib) is reserved for internal metadata; the second partition remains as the data volume for workload. Only new volumes are partitioned, and you can't use the partitioned volume with an older version of the HPCR image. Provisioning with an existing encrypted volume also works. The difference is that the existing volume does not get partitioned, and you can also go back to an older image with this volume.

   Support for using a dynamic registry reference
   - There exist use cases in which the registry is **not known** when the workload section is pre-encrypted, for example, when the workload provider wants to allow the deployer to use a registry mirror or a private container registry. In such a case, it's possible to dynamically override the registry and the pull credentials - which is a coordinated effort between the workload provider and the deployer. For more information, see [Using a dynamic registry reference](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-hyper-protect-virtual-server-use-dynamic-registry-reference).

Block Storage fast restore snapshots
:    You can now restore a fully provisioned volume with all its data from a snapshot by using a fast restore snapshot clone. You can use fast restore to restore a volume more quickly than restoring from a regular snapshot. To create the clone, you specify a zone or zones in the same region as the source snapshot. The clone is used to automatically restore a volume with all of its data in the zone where the clone exists. For more information, see [Restoring a volume by using fast restore](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore&interface=api#snapshots-vpc-use-fast-restore).

Extra security for VPC snapshots (closed beta)

A private catalog provides a way for you to manage access to products for multiple accounts. You can use any existing x86 virtual server custom image with a private catalog, with the exception of an encrypted image. For more information, see [Getting started with Catalog Images on VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-images-on-vpc-catalog&interface=terraform) and the tutorial [Onboarding a virtual server image for VPC](/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-vsivpc-tutorial). Custom images can't be deleted while being managed from a catalog and can only be managed from one catalog product offering version at a time. Deleting the catalog does not free its managed resources for a 7-day reclamation period. For more information, see [Deleting a custom image in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=ui#deleting-private-catalog-custom-image-vpc) and [Using resource reclamations](/docs/account?topic=account-resource-reclamation). If you plan to share images with other accounts, users in those accounts should be aware of considerations related to cross-account references to those images. For more information, see [Using cross-account image references in a private catalog](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-cloud-private-catalog&interface=ui#private-catalog-image-reference-vpc-ui). Custom images can also be published to the IBM Cloud catalog and to other (non-enterprise) accounts.

   You have until 13 December 2022 to upgrade to more secure ciphers. After this date, VPN connections using deprecated ciphers show a `status` of `down` (and no longer transfer data) until you upgrade from the weak cipher.

Additional VPN for VPC ciphers
:    VPN gateways now provide new algorithms to help meet your security and compliance requirements.

   * IKE policy now supports the `sha384` value for authentication, `aes192` for encryption, and `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `20`, `21`, `22`, `23`, `24`, and `31` values for Diffie–Hellman groups.

   * IPsec policy now supports `sha384` and `disabled` values for authentication, `aes192`, `aes128gcm16`, `aes192gcm16`, and `aes256gcm16` values for encryption, and `group_15`, `group_16`, `group_17`, `group_18`, `group_20`, `group_21`, `group_22`, `group_23`, `group_24`, and `group_31` Diffie–Hellman groups.

   Specifying IKE and IPsec policies when configuring a VPN connection is optional. If a policy is not selected, one is chosen through *auto-negotiation*. For more information, see [About policy negotiation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn#policy-negotiation).

A private catalog provides a way for you to manage access to products for multiple accounts. You can use any existing x86 virtual server custom image with a private catalog, with the exception of an encrypted image. For more information, see [Getting started with Catalog Images on VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started-images-on-vpc-catalog).

IBM Wazi as a Service (s390x processor architecture)
:   You can now create virtual server instances of IBM z/OS with IBM Wazi as a Service (Wazi aaS) image on IBM Z (s390x processor architecture) in IBM Cloud in the Tokyo (`jp-tok`), São Paulo (`br-sao`), Toronto (`ca-tor`), and London (`eu-gb`) regions. The option to select the Wazi aaS z/OS dev and test image is offered as an IBM Cloud allow-listed service. For more information, see [IBM Wazi as a Service product page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/wazi-as-a-service){: external}.

File Storage for VPC
:   You can now access a customer root key (CRK) from one account, and then use that key to encrypt file shares you create in another account. When you create the file share, you specify the CRN of a root key from the account that contains the key. For more information, see [Creating file shares with customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-byok-encryption).

Backup for VPC (GA)
:    You can now create automated backup snapshots of your Block Storage volumes. If your original volume is compromised, you can restore it from a backup snapshot. You create a backup policy to control which source volumes are selected for backup by matching user tags in the volume with tags that are defined in the policy. Each policy contains up to four backup plans, which define how often backup snapshots are taken (daily, weekly, monthly, or more frequently by using a cron-spec) and retained (by date or by count). You can also view backup jobs, which show status of backup snapshots that are being created or deleted. For more information about this service, see [Backup for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about).

Block Storage for VPC
:    You can use the `volumes` API to restore an unattached data volume from a snapshot. Restoring from a snapshot creates a new, fully provisioned volume. The data volume that was created from the snapshot is fully hydrated (data is restored) when you later attach it to an instance. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore).

File Storage for VPC
:    For accounts authorized to preview this service, you can increase or decrease file share IOPS to meet your performance needs. Adjust IOPS within an IOPS tier profile or a custom profile. Or, adjust IOPS between profiles, for example, from a 3 IOPS/GB tiered profile to a custom profile. Adjusting IOPS within a profile or between profiles depends on the file share size. For more information, see [Adjusting file share IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-adjusting-iops).

Secrets Manager for application load balancers
:   Application load balancers now support [IBM Secrets Manager](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started). With Secrets Manager, you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services or your custom-built applications.

IBM Cloud Certificate Manager - End of Support
:   As a reminder, end of support for IBM Cloud Certificate Manager was 31 December 2022. Remaining instances of Certificate Manager have been deleted. If you have any user-provided Ingress secrets stored in Certificate Manager, they are no longer valid.

File Storage for VPC
:    For accounts authorized to preview this service, you can configure replication for new and existing file shares. Replication creates a read-only copy of your file share data in a different zone. You can fail over to the replica share if the source share becomes damaged or compromised. For more information, see [About file share replication](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-replication).

:    You can now add user tags from the UI, CLI, or API when you create a new file share or update file shares. For more information, see [Adding user tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-managing&interface=ui#fs-add-tags-shares-ui).
