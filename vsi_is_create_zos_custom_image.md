{: note}
 
IBM Wazi Image Builder is a separately orderable product from [IBM Passport Advantage](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/){: external}. Extra requirements are needed to use Wazi Image Builder. The image cost is the premium that is applied to cover the cost of technologies that allows for z/OS dev and test images to run on IBM Z hardware on IBM’s cloud infrastructure as a service layer. 

The z/OS Wazi aaS custom image must meet the following requirements: 
* qcow2 format
* z/OS 2.4 or z/OS 2.5 operating system
* See [Prerequisites](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wazi-aas/1.1.0?topic=builder-prerequisites){: external} for required PTF fixes on z/OS and other IBM software products to allow them to run as a guest of alternate IBM hypervisor, IBM Z Hypervisor as a Service (zHYPaaS).

IBM Wazi Image Builder is licensed only for development, testing, employee education, or demonstration of your applications that run on z/OS. This product must not be used for production workloads of any kind, nor robust development workloads, production module builds, preproduction testing, stress testing, or performance testing.
