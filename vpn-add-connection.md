# Adding connections to a VPN gateway
{: #vpn-adding-connections}

You can add connections when [creating a VPN gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-create-gateway&interface=ui), or after provisioning one. When you configure a VPN connection, you can choose to connect with auto-negotiation or use a pre-defined custom IKE or IPsec policy. For more information, see [About policy negotiation](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn#policy-negotiation).
{: shortdesc}

The IKE and IPsec security options that you specify for the connection must exactly match the ones that are set on the peer gateway for the network outside your VPC.
{: important}

## Adding a connection in the console
{: #vpn-using-ui-add-connection}
{: ui}

To add a VPN connection to an existing VPN gateway, follow these steps:

1. Highlight the row of the gateway that you want to work with in the VPN gateways table, then click **Create connection** from the Actions menu ![Actions menu](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions").

   Alternatively, on the gateway's details page, you can click **Create** in the VPN connections section.
   {: note}



1. Define a connection between this gateway and a network outside your VPC by specifying the following information:
   * **VPN connection name** - Enter a name for the connection, such as `my-connection`.
   * **Peer gateway address** - Specify the IP address of the VPN gateway for the network outside your VPC.

      After you provision the VPN connection, you cannot change the peer gateway address type from IP address to FQDN, or from FQDN to IP address.
      {: note}

   

   * **Establish mode** - Select either **Bidirectional** or **Peer only**.

       - **Bidirectional** mode initiates IKE protocol negotiations (or rekeying processes) from either side of the VPN gateway.
       - **Peer only** mode allows the peer to initiate IKE protocol negotiations for this VPN gateway connection. The peer is also responsible for initiating the rekeying process after the connection is established.

      If your peer device is behind a NAT device and doesn't have a public IP address, make sure to specify **Peer only**.
      {: important}

   * **Preshared key** - Specify the authentication key of the VPN gateway for the network outside your VPC. The preshared key is a string of hexadecimal digits, or a passphrase of printable ASCII characters. To be compatible with most peer gateway types, this string must follow these rules:
      * Can be a combination of digits, lower or uppercase characters, or the following special characters: `- + & ! @ # $ % ^ * ( ) . , :`
      * The length of the string must be 6 - 128 characters.
      * Cannot start with `0x` or `0s`.

   * **Distribute traffic (Route-based VPN only)** - Enable this option to automatically distribute traffic between the active tunnels of the VPN gateway when a VPC route's next hop is the VPN connection. This option is useful to maximize throughput wherein two VPN tunnels connect to your remote peer network. If this option isn't enabled, the VPN gateway chooses the tunnel with the smaller public IP as the primary path, and switches to the secondary tunnel only if the primary goes down. For more information, see [Use case 4: Distributing traffic for a route-based VPN](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=ui#use-case-4-vpn).

   * **Local IBM CIDRs (Policy-based VPN only)** - Specify one or more CIDRs in the VPC that you want to connect through the VPN tunnel.
   * **Peer CIDRs (Policy-based VPN only)** - Specify one or more CIDRs in the other network that you want to connect through the VPN tunnel. Subnet range overlap between local and peer subnets is not allowed.



1. To configure how the VPN gateway sends messages to check that the peer gateway is active, specify the following information in the **Dead peer detection** section.
   * **Action** - The action to take if a peer gateway stops responding. For example, select **Restart** if you want the gateway to immediately renegotiate the connection.
   * **Interval (secs)** - How often to check that the peer gateway is active. By default, messages are sent every 2 seconds.
   * **Timeout (secs)** - How long to wait for a response from the peer gateway. By default, a peer gateway is considered inactive if a response isn't received within 10 seconds.
1. In the **Policies** section, specify the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) options to use for Phase 1 and Phase 2 negotiation of the connection.
   * Select **Auto** if you want the gateway to try to automatically establish the connection.
   * Select or create custom policies if:
      * You need to enforce particular security requirements.
      * The VPN gateway on the other network doesn't support the security proposals that are automatically negotiated during setup.


1. In the **Advanced options** section, you can customize local and peer IKE identities instead of using the default IKE identity. One peer IKE identity can be specified at most.

   For policy-based VPN gateways, you can configure one local IKE identity at most. For route-based VPN gateways, if you want to configure a local IKE identity, you must provide two. You can provide values for the members or leave the input fields empty.
   {: note}

   * **Local IKE identities** - Select a type for the local IKE identity, then enter its value. For example, you can enter a single 4 octet IPv4 address (`9.168.3.4`), an FQDN (`my-vpn.example.com`), hostname (`my-host`), or base64-encoded key ID (`MTIzNA==`).

      * Static route mode consists of two members in active-active mode, where the first identity applies to the first member and the second identity applies to the second member. If you do not specify local IKE identities, then the type is an IPv4 address, and the value is the public IP address of the memberâ€™s VPN connection tunnel.

      * Policy mode consists of two members in active-standby mode. The local IKE identity applies to the active member. If you do not specify a value, then the local IKE identity is the public IP address of the VPN gateway.

   * **Peer IKE identity** - Select a type for the peer IKE identity, then enter its value. For example, you can enter an IPv4 address (`9.168.3.4`), an FQDN (`my-vpn.example.com`), hostname (`my-host`), or base64-encoded key ID (`MTIzNA==`).

      The peer IKE identity applies to the active member. If you do not specify a value, then use the peer gateway's IPv4 address or FQDN.

1. Review the Summary panel, then click **Create VPN connection**.

## Adding a connection from the CLI
{: #vpn-using-cli-add-connection}
{: cli}

Before you begin, [set up your CLI environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli).

To create a VPN connection from the CLI, enter the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is vpn-gateway-connection-create CONNECTION_NAME VPN_GATEWAY PEER PRESHARED_KEY
[--vpc VPC] [--admin-state-up true | false] 
[--dead-peer-detection-action restart | clear | hold | none]
[--distribute-traffic true | false]
[--dead-peer-detection-interval INTERVAL] [--dead-peer-detection-timeout TIMEOUT] [--ike-policy IKE_POLICY_ID]
[--ipsec-policy IPSEC_POLICY_ID] [--peer-cidr CIDR1 --peer-cidr CIDR2 ... --local-cidr CIDR1 --local-cidr CIDR2 ...]
[[--local-ike-identity-type fqdn | hostname | ipv4_address | key_id --local-ike-identity-value VALUE] |
[--local-ike-identities LISTENER_POLICIES_JSON | @LISTENER_POLICIES_JSON_FILE]]
[--peer-ike-identity-type fqdn | hostname | ipv4_address | key_id --peer-ike-identity-value VALUE]
[--establish-mode bidirectional | peer_only] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
ibmcloud is vpn-gateway-connection-create CONNECTION_NAME VPN_GATEWAY PEER PRESHARED_KEY
```
{: codeblock}

Where:

`CONNECTION_NAME`
    : The name of the connection.

`VPN_GATEWAY`
    : The ID of the VPN gateway.

`PEER`
    : The IP address or FQDN of the peer VPN gateway.

`PRESHARED_KEY`
    : The preshared key.

`--vpc`
    : The ID or name of the VPC. This field is only required to specify the unique resource by its name inside this VPC.

`--admin-state-up`
    : If set to `false`, the VPN gateway connection is shut down. This field value can be either `true` or `false`.



`--dead-peer-detection-action`
    : The dead peer detection action. This field value can be either `restart`, `clear`, `hold`, or `none`. (Default: `restart`).

`--dead-peer-detection-interval`
    : The dead peer detection interval in seconds (default: `2`).

`--dead-peer-detection-timeout`
    :  The dead peer detection timeout in seconds (default: `10`).

`--distribute-traffic`
    :  Set to `true` to distribute traffic between the `Up` tunnels of the VPN gateway connection when a VPC route's next hop is the VPN connection. This value can be either `true` or `false`. For more information, see [Distributing traffic for a route-based VPN](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=terraform#use-case-4-vpn).

`--ike-policy`
    : The ID of the IKE policy.

`--ipsec-policy`
    : The ID of the IPsec policy.

`--local-ike-identity-type`
    : The type of local IKE identity. This field value can be either `fqdn`, `hostname`, `ipv4_address`, or `key_id`.

`--local-ike-identity-value`
    : The value of the local IKE identity.

`--local-ike-identities`
    : The ID of the local IKE identity. `LOCAL_IKE_IDENTITIES_JSON  | @LOCAL_IKE_IDENTITIES_JSON_FILE` in JSON or a JSON file.



`-peer-cidr`
    : The peer CIDRs for the resource.

`-local-cidr`
    : The local CIDR for the resource.

`-peer-ike-identity-type`
    : The type of peer IKE identity. This field value can either be `ipv4_address`, `fqdn`, `hostname`, or `key_id`.

`--peer-ike-identity-value`
    : The value of the peer IKE identity.

   Policy-based VPN gateways can have only one local IKE identity.

   If a route-based VPN gateway has local IKE identities that are specified, then there must be at least two; the first identity applies to the first member of the VPN gateway, and the second identity applies to the second member.

`--establish-mode`
    : This field can be either `bidirectional` or `peer_only`. Bidirectional mode initiates IKE protocol negotiations (or rekeying processes) from either side of the VPN gateway. Peer only mode allows the peer to initiate IKE protocol negotiations for this VPN gateway connection. The peer is also responsible for initiating the rekeying process after the connection is established. If rekeying doesn't occur, the VPN gateway connection is removed after its lifetime expires.

`-output`
    : Specifies that the output format is JSON.

`-q, --quiet`
    : Suppresses verbose output.

## Adding a connection by using Terraform
{: #vpn-using-cli-add-terraform}
{: terraform}

To add a connection by using Terraform, run the following command:

```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "is_vpn_gateway_connection" {
     name                 = "my-vpn-gateway-connection"
     vpn_gateway    = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.is_vpn_gateway.id
     peer_address   =  "7.8.9.10"
     preshared_key = var.presharedkey
     local_cidrs        = [var.localCIDR]
     peer_cidrs        = [var.peerCIDR]
   }
```
{: codeblock}

The following Terraform example creates a VPN gateway connection:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "is_vpn_gateway_connection" {
  name           = "my-vpn-gateway-connection"
  vpn_gateway    = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.is_vpn_gateway.id
  preshared_key  = "VPNDemoPassword"
  establish_mode = "bidirectional"
  peer {
    cidrs   = [var.peerCIDR]
    address = "7.8.9.10"
  }
  local {
    cidrs = [var.localCIDR]
  }
  ike_policy   = ibm_is_ike_policy.is_ike_policy.id
  ipsec_policy = ibm_is_ipsec_policy.is_ipsec_policy.id
}

The following Terraform example creates a VPN connection for a route-based VPN gateway with the [distribute traffic feature](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&interface=terraform#use-case-4-vpn) enabled:

```terraform

resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "test_VPNGatewayConnection1" {
    name = "example-vpn-gateway-connection"
    vpn_gateway = "${ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.id}"
    peer_address = "${ibm_is_vpn_gateway.example.public_ip_address}"
    preshared_key = "VPNDemoPassword"
    distribute-traffic = true
}
```
{: codeblock}

The following Terraform example creates a VPN connection by using advanced configuration options:

```terraform
resource "ibm_is_vpn_gateway_connection" "is_vpn_gateway_connection" {
  name           = "to-prem"
  vpn_gateway    = ibm_is_vpn_gateway.is_vpn_gateway.id
  preshared_key  = "test123"
  establish_mode = "peer_only"
  peer {
    cidrs   = ["192.168.0.0/24"]
    ike_identity {
      type  = "ipv4_address"
      value = "192.168.0.1"
    }
    fqdn = "on-prem.test.com"
  }
  local {
    cidrs = ["10.10.20.0/28"]
  }
}
```
