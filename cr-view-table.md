## Viewing details of a routing table from the CLI
{: #cr-routing-table-using-the-cli}
{: cli}

To view details of a specific routing table:

```sh
ibmcloud is vpc-routing-table VPC ROUTING_TABLE [--json]
```
{: pre}

To view details of the default routing table:

```sh
ibmcloud is vpc-default-routing-table VPC [--json]
```
{: pre}

To view details of a routing table that is attached to the subnet:

```sh
ibmcloud is subnet-routing-table SUBNET [--json]
```
{: pre}

Where:

`VPC`
:   Is the ID or name of the VPC.

`ROUTING_TABLE`
:   Is the ID or name of the VPC routing table.

`SUBNET`
:   Is the ID or name of the subnet.

`--json`
:   Formats output in JSON.

## Viewing details of a routing table with the API
{: #cr-routing-table-using-the-api}
{: api}

To view the details of a routing table with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#api-prerequisites-setup).
1. Store the following values in variables to be used in the API command:

    ```sh
    export VpcId=<your_vpc_id>
    export RoutingTableId=<your_routing_table_id>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. View details of a routing table:

   ```sh
   curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/vpcs/$VpcId/routing_tables/$RoutingTableId?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
        -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   To view the routing table that is attached to a subnet:

   ```sh
   export SubnetId=<your_subnet_id>
   curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/subnets/$SubnetId/routing_table?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
        -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
   ```
   {: codeblock}

## Viewing details of a routing table with Terraform
{: #cr-view-details-terraform}
{: terraform}

To view details of all or a specific routing table with Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Terraform environment.
1. Use one of the following examples:

   * To list and view details of all routing tables for a VPC:

      ```terraform
      data "ibm_is_vpc_routing_tables" "example" {
        vpc = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `ibm_is_vpc_routing_tables` resource, see the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_vpc_routing_tables).{: external}

   * To retrieve a single routing table specified by the identifier:

      ```terraform
      data "ibm_is_vpc_routing_table" "example_routing_table" {
        vpc                 = ibm_is_vpc.example_vpc.id
        routing_table     = ibm_is_vpc_routing_table.example_rt.routing_table
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `ibm_is_vpc_routing_table` resource, see the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_vpc_routing_table).{: external}

   * To retrieve the default routing table for the VPC specified by the identifier:

      ```terraform
      data "ibm_is_vpc_default_routing_table" "example" {
        vpc = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
      }
      ```

      For more information about the `ibm_is_vpc_default_routing_table` resource, see the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_vpc_default_routing_table).{: external}
