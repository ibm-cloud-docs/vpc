# Updating a routing table
{: #update-vpc-routing-table}

You can update a routing table by using the console, CLI, API, or Terraform.
{: shortdesc}

## Updating a routing table in the console
{: #cr-updating-the-ui}
{: ui}

To update a routing table in the console, follow these steps:

1. Make sure to review [Limitations and guidelines](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-custom-routes&interface=ui#limitations-custom-routes).
1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, select the **Navigation Menu** ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), then click **Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) > **Network** > **Routing tables**. The Routing tables for VPC page appears.
1. Locate the routing table in the table. You can:

   * Use the Actions menu ![Actions menu](images/overflow.png) to rename or delete the routing table.
   * Click the routing table's name to view its details page. From the Overview tab, you can do the following:

      * Click **Add tags** to add a tag, or click the Edit icon ![Edit icon](images/edit.png) to edit your tags for the routing table.
      * Click the Edit icon ![Edit icon](images/edit.png) to rename the routing table.
      * Click the Actions menu ![Actions menu](images/overflow.png) to delete the routing table.
      * In the Traffic section, click the Edit icon ![Edit icon](images/edit.png) to edit the traffic configuration and manage routes.
      * In the Routes section, manage existing routes, or click **Create** to add a route.

## Updating a routing table from the CLI
{: #cr-update-the-cli-ct}
{: cli}

Before you begin, [set up your CLI environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli).

To update a routing table from the CLI, run the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud is vpc-routing-table-update VPC ROUTING_TABLE [--name NEW_NAME] [--direct-link-ingress false | true] [--internet-ingress, --internet false | true] [--transit-gateway-ingress false | true] [--vpc-zone-ingress false | true] [--accept-routes-from-resource-type-filters, --ar-rtf vpn_server | vpn_gateway | --clean-all-accept-routes-from-filters, --cl-arf] [--advertise_routes_to TARGETS] [--output JSON] [-q, --quiet]
```
{: pre}

Where:

`VPC`
:   Is the ID or name of the VPC.

`ROUTING_TABLE`
:   Is the ID or name of the VPC routing table.

`--name`
:   Is the new name of the routing table.

`--direct-link-ingress, ``direct-link`
:   Optional. If set to **true**, the routing table is used to route traffic that originates from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link to this VPC. For the routing to succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with this property set to **true**. One of: **false**, **true**.

`--internet-ingress, --internet`
:   Indicates whether this routing table is used to route traffic that originates from the internet. Updating to **true** selects this routing table, provided no other routing table in the VPC already has this property set to **true**. Updating to **false** deselects this routing table. One of: **false**, **true**.

`--transit-gateway-ingress, --transit-gateway`
:   If set to **true**, this routing table is used to route traffic that originates from Transit Gateway to this VPC. For the routing to succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with this property set to **true**. One of: **false**, **true**.

`--vpc-zone-ingress, --vpc-zone`
:   If set to **true**, this routing table is used to route traffic that originates from subnets in other zones in this VPC. For the routing to succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with this property set to **true**. One of: **false**, **true**.

`--accept-routes-from-resource-type-filters, --ar-rtf`
:   The comma-separated resource type filters that can create routes in this routing table. All learned routes from resources that match a resource filter are removed when an existing resource filter is removed. One of: **vpn_server**, **vpn_gateway**.

`--clean-all-accept-routes-from-filters, --cl-arf`
:   Remove all accept routes from filters and delete all learned routes from the routing table.

`--advertise_routes_to TARGETS`
:   Is a comma-separated list of advertisement targets for routes in this routing table. Currently, `direct_link` and `transit_gateway` are the allowed values. `direct_link` requires `direct-link-ingress` to be set to **true**. `transit_gateway` requires `transit—gateway-ingress` to be set to **true**. All routes in the routing table with the **advertise** option set to **true** are advertised to the ingress sources specified by 'advertise_routes_to'.

`--output`
:   Is the output format. One of: **JSON**.

`-q, --quiet`
:   Suppresses verbose output.

Routes with an action of **deliver** are treated as **drop** unless the next-hop is an IP address that is bound to a network interface on a subnet in the route’s zone. Hence, if an incoming packet matches a route with a next-hop of an internet-bound IP address or a VPN gateway connection, the packet is dropped.
{: important}

You can set an ingress option to **true** on only one routing table per VPC, and then only if that routing table is not attached to any subnets.

`ibmcloud is vpc-routing-table-update vpc-doloremque-6364-us-east  test-vpc-cli-routing-tb2 --direct-link-ingress true --internet-ingress false --transit-gateway-ingress true  --vpc-zone-ingress false`

`ibmcloud is vpc-routing-table-update 979b4bc6-f018-40a2-92f5-0b1cf777b55d  27415d55-9d3b-4adb-a993-236ef59a45ec --direct-link-ingress false --internet-ingress false   --transit-gateway-ingress false  --vpc-zone-ingress false`

## Updating a routing table with the API
{: #cr-update-the-api-ct}
{: api}

To create a routing table with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#api-prerequisites-setup).
1. Store the `VpcId` and `RoutingTableId` values in a variable to be used in the API command:

    ```sh
    export VpcId=<your_vpc_id>
    export RoutingTableId=<your_routing_table_id>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1.  Update the name of a routing table:

    ```curl
    curl -X PATCH \
    "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/vpcs/$VpcId/routing_tables/$RoutingTableId?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
    -H "Authorization: ${iam_token}" \
    -d '{
          "name": "test-routing-table-updated"
        }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Update a routing table to be used for routing traffic from the internet:

    ```curl
    curl -X PATCH \
    "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/vpcs/$VpcId/routing_tables/$RoutingTableId?version=$api_version&generation=2" \
    -H "Authorization: ${iam_token}" \
    -d '{
          "route_internet_ingress": true
        }'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Updating a routing table with Terraform
{: #cr-update-terraform}
{: terraform}

To update a routing table with Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Terraform environment.
1. Use one of the following examples:

   * To update a routing table:

      ```terraform
      resource "ibm_is_vpc_routing_table" "example" {
        vpc                           = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
        name                          = "example-vpc-routing-table"
      }
      ```

   * To update an existing routing table with the `route-internet-ingress` attribute:

      ```terraform
      resource "ibm_is_vpc_routing_table" "example" {
        vpc                              = ibm_is_vpc.example.id
        name                             = "example-vpc-routing-table"
        route_internet_ingress           = true
      }
      ```

      If `route_internet_ingress` is set to `true`, this routing table is used to route traffic that originates from the internet. For the routing to succeed, the VPC must not already have a routing table with this property set to `true`.

For documentation about the `ibm_is_vpc_routing_table` resource, see the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_vpc_routing_table).{: external}
