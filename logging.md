# Logging for VPC
{: #logging}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, generate platform logs that you can use to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions in your account, and troubleshoot problems.
{: shortdesc}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route platform logs in your account to a destination of your choice by configuring a tenant that defines where platform logs are sent. For more information, see [About Logs Routing](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on platform logs that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

## Locations where platform logs are generated
{: #log-locations}
