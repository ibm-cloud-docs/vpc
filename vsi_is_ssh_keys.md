# Managing SSH keys
{: #managing-ssh-keys}

To access {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}} instances, you must have an SSH key available to use. You can, create, update, and delete SSH keys in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, CLI, and API.
{: shortdesc}

Managing keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or CLI has no effect on keys in instances that are already created. (For an existing Linux instance, you can edit keys directly in the `~/.ssh/` directory of the instance.)

{{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} supports two different types of public SSH keys.

* RSA
* Ed25519

You can generate new RSA key pairs using the UI. Pre-existing RSA and Ed25519 SSH keys can be uploaded. Ed25519 can be used only if the operating system supports this key type. Ed25519 can't be used with Windows or VMware images.
{: note}

## Before you begin
{: #prereq-ssh-key-available}

To create a virtual server instance, you must create or upload an SSH key and have it available so that you can connect to your instance after it is provisioned.

## Managing SSH keys with IBM Cloud console
{: #managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console}
{: ui}

When you provision a virtual server, you can create a new SSH key, select from an available list of existing SSH keys or upload a new one.

1. In [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, go to **Navigation Menu** icon![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > SSH keys**. Any existing SSH keys are displayed.
1. On the **SSH keys for VPC** tab, click the Actions icon ![More Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for an SSH key and select from the available options.
   | Action            | Description            |
   | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Rename | After you update an existing SSH key, the key is renamed immediately. |
   | Delete | After you remove an SSH key, it can no longer be used when you provision an instance or when you perform an OS reload on an existing instance. However, the key is still available on any instances that you previously provisioned with it, and you can use it to log in. |
   {: caption="SSH key actions" caption-side="bottom"}

   | SSH key type | Select a key type for the SSH key. The default value is `rsa`. The `ed25519` SSH key type can be used only to create instances if the operating system supports this key type. This key type can't be used with Windows or VMware images. |
   {: caption="Creating an SSH key for VPC selections" caption-side="bottom"}

1. Select **Provide existing public key**.
1. Click **Upload public key**.
1. Select the public key file and click **Open**. The file extension, `.pub`, typically indicates which file contains the public key.
1. Optionally, click **Get sample API call** to get an API code with all your SSH key information that you can copy.
1. Click **Create**.

If you copy an SSH key from a terminal to add the key to your VPC, sometimes extra line breaks are introduced which cause a parsing error. To avoid this issue, first paste your SSH key into a text editor and remove any extra line breaks. Then, copy the SSH key from text editor and paste it into the VPC UI, CLI, or API.
{: tip}

Your imported SSH key is now displayed in the list of SSH keys on the UI.

## Importing your SSH key by using the CLI
{: #generating-ssh-keys-cli}
{: cli}

To import an SSH key by using the CLI, use the **ibmcloud is key-create** command. The file that you import is `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, which contains your public key. You must specify the name or ID of the SSH key by using the `KEY_NAME` variable and the public SSH key you are importing by using the `KEY` variable. Specify the SSH key type with the `--key-type` option. Optionally, you can specify a resource group when you create the SSH key. Specify the resource group by using either the `RESOURCE_GROUP_ID` or `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` variable. See [ibmcloud is key-create](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-reference#key-create) in the VPC CLI reference guide.

```sh
ibmcloud is key-create KEY_NAME (KEY | @KEY_FILE) [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--key-type KEY_TYPE]
```
{: pre}

## Importing your SSH key by using the API
{: #importing-ssh-keys-api}
{: api}

To import a new SSH key by using the API, use the [Create a key](/apidocs/vpc/latest#create-key). The file that you import is `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, which contains your public key. You can't create a brand-new SSH key by using the API. However, you can create a new SSH key by using the UI and from the UI, generate the API code snippet that you need that includes the new SSH key. For more information, see [Creating an SSH key by using the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-ssh-keys&interface=ui#generating-ssh-keys-ui).

For the `name` property, specify the name of the SSH key. For `public_key` property, enter in the public key information. For the `type` property, specify either `rsa` or `ed25519` for the SSH key type.

The Ed25519 SSH key type can be used only to create instances if the operating system supports this key type. This key type can't be used with Windows or VMware images.

## Importing your SSH key by using Terraform
{: #importing-ssh-keys-terraform}
{: terraform}

To import a new SSH key by using Terraform, use [ibm_is_ssh_keys](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/is_ssh_key#import){: external}.

To import a new SSH key, complete the following steps.

1. Create a resource block type of `ibm_is_ssh_key` with the required values. For the `name` attribute, specify the dummy name of the SSH key. For `public_key` attribute, enter in the dummy public key information.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "example_sshkey" {
     name = "my-key"
     public_key = "public-key"
   }
   ```
   {: pre}

1. After creating the resource, run the following Terraform command to import the SSH key.

  ```terraform
   terraform import ibm_is_ssh_key.example_sshkey d7bec597-4726-451f-8a63-e62e6f19c32c
   ```
   {: pre}

1. Improve the configuration to match the state. Copy over the resource block details to avoid replacing the resource block.

   ```terraform
   resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "example_sshkey" {
      name       = "example-sshkey"
      public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCKVmnMOlHKcZK8tpt3MP1lqOLAcqcJzhsvJcjscgVERRN7/9484SOBJ3HSKxxNG5JN8owAjy5f9yYwcUg+JaUVuytn5Pv3aeYROHGGg+5G346xaq3DAwX6Y5ykr2fvjObgncQBnuU5KHWCECO/4h8uWuwh/kfniXPVjFToc+gnkqA+3RKpAecZhFXwfalQ9mMuYGFxn+fwn8cYEApsJbsEmb0iJwPiZ5hjFC8wREuiTlhPHDgkBLOiycd20op2nXzDbHfCHInquEe/gYxEitALONxm0swBOwJZwlTDOB7C6y2dzlrtxr1L59m7pCkWI4EtTRLvleehBoj3u7jB4usR"
