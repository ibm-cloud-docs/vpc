# Creating a virtual server with SGX or TDX
{: #creating-virtual-server-with-confidential-computing-vpc}

[Select availability]{: tag-green}

You can create one or more virtual server instances with SGX or TDX in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC.
{: shortdesc}

Confidential computing profiles are available in the Dallas (us-south), Washington DC (us-east), and Frankfurt (eu-de) regions. Confidential computing with Intel SGX for VPC is Dallas (us-south), Washington DC (us-east), and Frankfurt (eu-de). Confidential computing with Intel TDX for VPC is available only in the Washington DC (us-east) region. If you want to create a virtual server instance with a confidential computing profile and TDX, you can create that virtual server instance only in the Washington DC (us-east) region. You canâ€™t create a virtual server instance with TDX in any other region, including Dallas (us-south) and Frankfurt (eu-de). For more information, see [Confidential computing known issues](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-known-issues#confidential-computing-vpc-known-issues). Confidential computing is only available with select profiles. For more information, see [Confidential computing profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui#confidential-computing-profiles).

## Creating a virtual server with confidential computing
{: #creating-virtual-server-with-confidential-computing-vpc-steps}

Use the following steps to create a virtual server with confidential computing.

Make sure that you created a VPC.
{: tip}

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click **Navigation Menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> VPC Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../../icons/vpc.svg) **> Compute > Virtual server instances**.
1. Click **Create** and select or enter the following information.
1. Select a location.
1. Enter a unique name for your virtual server instance.
1. Select an available image. For more information about SGX- or TDX-supported images, see [Limitations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-confidential-computing-vpc#limitations-confidential-computing-vpc-sgx).
1. Select an SGX- or TDX-supported profile by clicking **Confidential computing**. Keep in mind that only the Balanced _bx3dc_ profiles and Compute _cx3dc_ profiles support SGX or TDX.
1. Click **Save**.
1. SGX is the default value. Keep the SGX confidential computing value or select TDX confidential computing. Secure boot is automatically enabled. Keep in mind that you can enable secure boot without enabling either SGX or TDX, but you can't enable SGX or TDX without enabling secure-boot.
1. Select an existing public SSH key or click **Create an SSH key** to create a new one. For more information about creating an SSH key, see [Creating your SSH key by using the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys&interface=ui#generate-ssh-keys-ui).
1. Go to **Networking**, and choose a **VPC** for this virtual server instance.
1. Click **Create a virtual server instance** when you are ready to provision. After your new virtual server with SGX or TDX is provisioned, it's ready to use.
