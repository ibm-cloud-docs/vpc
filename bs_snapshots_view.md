# Viewing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} snapshots and consistency groups
{: #snapshots-vpc-view}

You can view a list of all snapshots and consistency groups, and drill down to see information about a particular snapshot. Choose the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform to retrieve this information.
{: shortdesc}

You can use allowed-use expressions with bootable block storage snapshots to define the capabilities and restrictions of a snapshot and help you find compatible image and profile combinations during server creation. To use allowed-use expressions with your snapshots, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui).

Fast restore snapshot clones and consistency groups are not supported for second-generation storage volumes in the current release. During the select availability phase, you can't create a copy of your second-generation snapshot in another region if your snapshot is encrypted with a customer-managed key or if the snapshot's source volume is bigger than 10 TB.

## Listing snapshots in the console
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-ui}
{: ui}

You can use the UI to list your snapshots and consistency groups.

### Listing all snapshots in the console
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-list-ui}

In the console, you can view a list of all snapshots that you created, with the most recent one at the beginning of the list. You can filter the list to view specific snapshots.

The Snapshots list displays the snapshots within the consistency group and provides the same information and actions as described in [Table 1](#snapshots-vpc-view-list-ui).

## Viewing snapshots from the CLI
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-cli}
{: cli}

You can use the CLI to list all snapshots, all snapshots for a volume, and details about a particular snapshot.

### Before you begin
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-cli-requirement}

Before you can use the CLI, you must install the IBM Cloud CLI and the VPC CLI plug-in. For more information, see the [CLI prerequisites](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#cli-prerequisites-setup).
{: requirement}

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.

   ```sh
   ibmcloud login --sso -a cloud.ibm.com
   ```
   {: pre}

   This command returns a URL and prompts for a passcode. Go to that URL in your browser and log in. If successful, you get a one-time passcode. Copy this passcode and paste it as a response on the prompt. After successful authentication, you are prompted to choose your account. If you have access to multiple accounts, select the account that you want to log in as. Respond to any remaining prompts to finish logging in.

1. Set the `IBMCLOUD_IS_FEATURE_SNAPSHOT` environment variable to `true`.

   ```sh
   export IBMCLOUD_IS_FEATURE_SNAPSHOT=true
   ```
   {: pre}

### Viewing all snapshots of an account in a region from the CLI

* The `allowed-used` properties are inherited from the source volume or snapshot at creation time. You can change their value either at creation time or later if you are authorized to the `is.snapshot.snapshot.manage-allowed-use` IAM role. The properties comprise a Boolean [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md){: external} expression. When the instance expression is evaluated to be `true`, then the provisioning of a virtual server instance is allowed with the snapshot. When the expression is evaluated to be `false`, the provisioning is blocked. If the value is not specified at the time of creation, then the constraint expressions are taken from the source resource.

The following example shows the details of a nonbootable snapshot in the `eu-de` region, which also has a fast restore clone in the `eu-de-1` zone.

## Listing snapshots with the API
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-all-api}
{: api}

You can list your snapshots by using the API.

### Listing all snapshots with the API
{: #snapshots-vpc-list-all-api}

You can programmatically list all snapshots of your volumes by calling the `/snapshots` method in the [VPC API](/apidocs/vpc/latest#list-snapshots){: external} as shown in the following sample request. By default, the list shows the most recent snapshots first, followed by older snapshots in descending order.

```sh
curl -X GET \
  "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/snapshots?version=2022-12-16&generation=2" \
  -H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

You can filter the list by using the resource group ID, source volume ID, or source volume CRN, and further filter the results by using the following options:

* Limit - To control the number of snapshots displayed on a page.
* Start - To specify which snapshot (by ID) to start the list.
* Sort - To control the order in which you sort the page, such as by date created or alphabetically by snapshot name.

For example, the following call filters the list to show snapshots that were created for a single volume and limits the results to five per page.

```sh
curl -X GET \
"$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/snapshots?version=2022-08-16&generation=2" \
-H "Authorization: $iam_token" \
-d '{
      "limit": 5,
      "source_volume":

* The `allowed-used` properties are inherited from the source volume or snapshot at creation time. You can change their value either at creation time or later if you are authorized to the `is.snapshot.snapshot.manage-allowed-use` IAM role. The properties comprise a Boolean [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md){: external} expression. When the instance expression is evaluated to be `true`, then the provisioning of a virtual server instance is allowed with the snapshot. When the expression is evaluated to be `false`, the provisioning is blocked. If the value is not specified at the time of creation, then the constraint expressions are taken from the source resource.

### Viewing all fast restore snapshot clones with the API

## Viewing snapshots with Terraform
{: #snapshots-vpc-view-terraform}
{: terraform}

You can use Terraform to view your snapshots.

To use Terraform, download the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. For more information, see [Getting started with Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).
{: requirement}

VPC infrastructure services use a specific regional endpoint, which targets to `us-south` by default. If your VPC is created in another region, make sure to target the appropriate region in the provider block in the `provider.tf` file.

See the following example of targeting a region other than the default `us-south`.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-de"
}
```
