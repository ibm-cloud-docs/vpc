# {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} profiles
{: #block-storage-profiles}

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, CLI, API, or Terraform you specify a volume profile that best meets your storage requirements. Profiles are generally available as three predefined IOPS levels or with custom IOPS. The volume profiles from the _tiered_ family provide reliable IOPS/GB performance for volumes up to 16,000 GB capacity. With a _custom_ volume profile, you can specify your own IOPS value in a range that is appropriate for your selected volume capacity.
{: shortdesc}

Customers with special access can provision storage with the new `sdp` profile. The `sdp` profile is available in the Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Osaka, Sao Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and Washington, DC regions during the select availability release. For more information about this release, such as billing, supported features, and limitations, see [About {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about#block-storage-sdp-intro).

## Block Storage profile families
{: #block-storage-profile-overview}

When you create a Block Storage volume, you can select from various profiles.
- [Select availability]{: tag-green} The defined performance family profile provides even more flexibility when it comes to specifying capacity and IOPS. Volume profiles in the defined performance family can scale volume performance independent of capacity. By using the `sdp` profile, you can create a volume with up to 32 TB capacity and an IOPS value in a range of 100 - 64,000.
- Select a profile from the _tiered_ profile family when you want to pick a profile where performance scales with capacity of the volume.
- Select the profile from the _custom_ profile family if your performance requirements don't fall within any of the predefined IOPS tiers. When you select the custom profile, you can define your IOPS within a range that depends on the capacity that you specified. 

The `sdp` profile is available in the Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Osaka, Sao Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and Washington, DC regions during the select availability release for allowlisted customers. The _custom_ and _tiered_ profiles are available in every region for every customer. 

The following table shows the available storage profiles with their different properties.

| Family name  | Profile name      | Capacity range \n (GB) | IOPS rate \n (IOPS/GB)  | IOPS range [^ttext1] \n (IOPS)| Max throughput[^ttext2]|
|--------------|-------------------|---------------:|----------------------:|------------------:|-----------------------:|
| defined performance | `sdp`      |     1 - 32,000 | 100 - 64k | 100 - 64,000[^ttext4] | 1024 MBps \n (8192 Mbps)|
| tiered       | `general-purpose` |    10 - 16,000 |  3        | 3,000 - 48,000 |  670 MBps \n (5360 Mbps)| 
| tiered       | `5iops-tier`      |    10 -  9,600 |  5        | 3,000 - 48,000 |  768 MBps \n (6144 Mbps) |
| tiered       | `10iops-tier`     |    10 -  4,800 | 10        | 3,000 - 48,000 | 1024 MBps \n (8192 Mbps)|

{: caption="Block Storage profiles and performance levels." caption-side="bottom"}

[^ttext1]: The provisioned IOPS values are based on a preset 16k I/O size.
[^ttext2]: Max throughput is determined by the number of IOPS multiplied by the preset throughput multiplier. The throughput multiplier is 16 KB for 3 IOPS/GB or 5 IOPS/GB tiers. The throughput multiplier for the 10 IOPS/GB tier and the custom profile is 256 KB. The higher the IOPS that you specify, the higher the throughput limit becomes.
[^ttext3]: The available IOPS range depends on the volume capacity. For more information, see [Table 3](#custom).
[^ttext4]: The IOPS value is independent of the volume capacity.

Nominal IOPS values are based on 16k I/O size. The maximum throughput value is determined by the number of IOPS multiplied by the throughput multiplier. The throughput multiplier is 16 KB for 3 IOPS/GB or 5 IOPS/GB tiers, or 256 KB for 10 IOPS/GB or custom IOPS tiers. The higher the IOPS that you specify, the higher the throughput the volume can handle.

The application I/O size directly impacts storage performance. If the application I/O size is smaller than the throughput multiplier that is used by the profile to calculate the volumeâ€™s bandwidth limit, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit. Conversely, if the application I/O size is larger, the throughput limit is reached before the IOPS limit. For more information, see [How I/O size affects performance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-capacity-performance#how-block-size-affects-performance).

Moving volumes across volume-profiles that belong to different families is not allowed.

### SSD defined performance profile
{: #defined-performance-profile}

The SSD defined performance (`sdp`) profile is a second-generation volume profile that offers more flexibility than the previous custom profile when it comes to specifying capacity and performance. By using the `sdp` profile, you can specify the capacity, and the maximum throughput limit. Volume size can range from 1 - 32,000 GB. You can specify volume performance in the range of 3000 - 64,000 IOPS. In addition, you can also specify the maximum throughput value of your volume. The available throughput range is 125-1024 MBps (1000-8192 Mbps). The following table shows the minimum and maximum values of IOPS and Throughput in relation to the volume capacity.

| Capacity range (GB) | Min IOPS  | Max IOPS  | Min Throughput (Mbps) | Max Throughput (Mbps)  |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 - 20              | 3000      | 3000      |         1000          |          1000          |
| 21 - 50             | 3000      | 5000      |         1000          |          4096          |
| 51 - 80             | 3000      | 20000     |         1000          |          6144          |
| 81 - 100            | 3000      | 30000     |         1000          |          8192          |
| 101 - 130           | 3000      | 45000     |         1000          |          8192          |
| 131 - 150           | 3000      | 60000     |         1000          |          8192          |
| 151 - 32000         | 3000      | 64000     |         1000          |          8192          |
{: caption="Available capacity and performance ranges for the SSD defined performance profile." caption-side="bottom"}

To achieve more than 48,000 IOPS, the volume must be attached to a virtual server instance with a [3rd generation instance profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui#next-gen-profiles). The new generation features virtual server profile families that are hosted exclusively on Intel 4th Generation Xeon Scalable processors to provide the most powerful and performant profiles available.
{: note}

Certain volume operations such as increasing capacity, adjusting IOPS, and adjusting throughput can be done on an `sdp` volume even if the volume is not attached to a running instance. For more information about the allow-listed select availability release, such as billing, supported features, and limitations, see [About {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}}](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about#block-storage-sdp-intro).

### Tiered volume profiles
{: #tiers}

When you create your storage volume, you can select from three predefined IOPS tiers. Choose the profile that provides optimal performance for your Compute workloads. Table 2 describes the IOPS performance that you can expect for each tier.

| Intended workload | Capacity range (GB)	| IOPS rate (IOPS/GB)	|  IOPS range	| Throughput multiplier (KB) |
|------------------|------------:|----------------:|-------------:|----------------------:|
| `general-purpose` - Workloads that host small databases for web applications or store virtual machine disk images for a hypervisor. |  10 - 16,000 | 3 IOPS/GB  | 3,000	- 48,000 | 16  |
| `5iops-tier` - High I/O intensity workloads - Workloads characterized by a large percentage of active data, such as transactional and other performance-sensitive databases.|  10 - 9,600 | 5 IOPS/GB | 3,000 - 48,000 | 16  |
| `10iops-tier` - Demanding storage workloads - Data intensive workloads created by NoSQL databases, data processing for video, machine learning, and analytics.| 10 - 4,800 | 10 IOPS/GB | 3,000 - 48,000 | 256  | 
{: caption="IOPS tier profiles and performance levels for each tier" caption-side="bottom"}

Max IOPS for all volume profiles from the _tiered_ family starts at 3,000 IOPS. Max IOPS then increases, based on the storage tier and volume size, up to the Max IOPS in Table 2. While you can't customize the IOPS value of a volume with a tiered profile, you can change the volume to another tiered profile and adjust the IOPS that way.

### Custom volume profile
{: #custom}

Custom IOPS is a good option when you have well-defined performance requirements that do not fall within a predefined IOPS tier. You can customize the IOPS by specifying the total IOPS for the volume within the range for its volume size. You can provision volumes with IOPS performance from 100 IOPS to 48,000 IOPS, based on volume size.

The following table shows the available IOPS ranges based on volume capacity for the custom profile. 

| Intended workload | Capacity range (GB)	| IOPS range    | Throughput multiplier (KB)| 
|-------------------|--------------------:|--------------:|--------------------------:|
| Custom            | 10 - 39             | 100 - 1,000   |                       256 |
|                   | 40 - 79             | 100 - 2,000   |                       256 |
|                   | 80 - 99             | 100 - 4,000   |                       256 |
|                   | 100 - 499           | 100 - 6,000   |                       256 |
|                   | 500 - 999           | 100 - 10,000  |                       256 |
|                   | 1,000 - 1,999       | 100 - 20,000  |                       256 |
|                   | 2,000 - 3,999       | 200 - 40,000  |                       256 |
|                   | 4,000 - 7,999       | 300 - 40,000  |                       256 |
|                   | 8,000 - 9,999       | 500 - 48,000  |                       256 |
|                   | 10,000 - 16,000     | 1,000 - 48,000|                       256 |
{: caption="Available IOPS based on volume size" caption-side="bottom"}

If your application needs more IOPS and throughput, you can increase the volume size and specify a new IOPS value in a higher range. Capacity and IOPS can be modified only when the volume is attached to a running instance.

## Profiles for boot volumes
{: #vsi-profiles-boot}

By default, boot volumes are created with the `general-purpose` volume profile with 100 GB capacity during instance provisioning. [Boot volume capacity](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-resize-boot-volumes) can be increased by modifying the boot volume, up to 250 GB. Boot volume IOPS and bandwidth are never reduced to be less than 3000 IOPS or 393 Mbps.

You can use the console, the CLI, or the API to create boot volumes with the `sdp` profile up to 250-GB capacity, and specify 3000 or more IOPS for better performance. It's also possible to increase the size of the `sdp` profile-based boot volume to 32 TB after it is provisioned. However, when the boot volume capacity is increased over 250 GB, you can no longer create a custom image from that volume.

## How virtual server profiles relate to volume profiles
{: #vsi-profiles-relate-to-storage}

Virtual server profiles are a combination of vCPU and RAM that can be instantiated quickly to start a virtual server instance. Select from [three families of instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles#profiles) based on your workload requirements. These requirements can range from common workloads to CPU-intensive or memory-intensive workloads.

Similarly, volume profiles provide a range of capacity and performance for secondary volumes. By default, a 100 GB primary boot volume is created when you create a virtual server instance. You can also create and attach secondary volumes. When you create a data volume as part of instance creation, you can select a volume profile that best meets your storage requirements for your Compute workloads. In general, as your Compute requirements increase, you need higher IOPS performance. Table 4 shows this relationship.

| IOPS tier storage profile | Virtual server profile                                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 IOPS/GB       | [Balanced](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles#balanced) for common workloads.      |
| 5 IOPS/GB       | [Compute](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles#compute) for intensive CPU demands.   |
| 10 IOPS/GB      | [Memory](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles#memory) for memory-intensive workloads.|

## Storage capacity
{: #note-about-measurement-unit}

In this documentation, we refer to storage capacity by using the unit GB (Gigabytes) to align with the industry standard terminology. However, the actual provisioning and billing of storage are based on GiB (Gibibytes).

The difference between GB and GiB lies in their numerical representation:
- GB (Gigabyte) is a decimal unit, where 1 GB equals 1,000,000,000 bytes
- GiB (Gibibyte), is a binary unit, where 1 GiB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes

To ensure transparency, please note that your provisioned storage and associated charges are calculated based on GiB. Rest assured that you receive the exact amount of storage you expect and are billed accurately for the GiB you use. For more information, see the [FAQs](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-faq#faq-storage-units).

## Viewing available volume profiles
{: #view-iops-profiles}

You can view available volume profiles by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} UI, CLI, API, or Terraform.

### In the console
{: #using-console-iops-profile}
{: ui}

Customers with special access can create Block Storage volumes with the `sdp` profile.
{: preview}

As an allow-listed customer, you can see a list of all the available profiles in the Create block storage page, such as the 'sdp' profile, the three `tiered`, and the `custom` profile. When you select one of the tiered profiles, you need to specify the capacity. When you select the custom profile, you need to specify the capacity and an IOPS value that's in the applicable range for your capacity ([Table 3](#custom)). When you select the `sdp` profile, you can specify the capacity and IOPS without any capacity-based range restriction. You can also specify the maximum throughput limit for your volume.

### From the CLI
{: #using-cli-iops-profiles}
{: cli}

To view the list of available profiles by using the CLI, run the following command:
```sh
ibmcloud is volume-profiles
```
{: pre}

```sh

### With the API
{: #using-api-iops-profiles}
{: api}

To see the available profiles, make a `GET /volume/profiles` request.

```sh
curl -X GET \
$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/volume/profiles?$api_version&generation=2 \
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

For most accounts, the API responds with the fields `name`, `href`, `family`. For accounts with special access to preview the defined performance profile, the response is enhanced to include the following fields:

- `boot_capacity` denotes the capacity values that are permissible for boot volumes for each profile. The returned value is a range with minimum and maximum values that are specified for each profile.
   - For `custom` and `tiered` profiles, the range is 10 GB - 250 GB.
   - For the `sdp` profile, the range is 10 GB - 250 GB.
- `capacity` denotes the capacity values that are permissible for data volumes for each profile. The returned value is a range with minimum and maximum values that are specified for each profile.
   - For `custom` and `tiered` profiles, the range is 10 GB - 16 TB.
   - For the `sdp` profile, the range is 1 GB - 32 TB.
- `iops`, this field denotes the achievable IOPS under each profile.
   - For the `tiered` profiles, this value is fixed: 3 IOPS/GB, 5 IOPS/GB, and 10 IOPS/GB.
   - For the `custom` profile, this value can range between 1 - 48,000.
   - For the `sdp` profile, this value can range between 1 - 64,000.
- `family` enum now has an extra value,`defined_performance`, along with the `tiered` and `custom` values that exist today.
- `adjustable_capacity_states` indicates whether the capacity for the volume can be changed when the volume is not attached to a running virtual server instance. This field is informational. It describes the characteristics of the volume profile and cannot be changed.
   - For `custom` and `tiered` profiles, this value is `attached`.
   - For the `sdp` profile, this value is `attached, unattached`.
- `adjustable_iops_states` indicates whether the IOPS for the volume can be changed when the volume is not attached to a running virtual server instance. This field is informational. It describes the characteristics of the volume profile and cannot be changed.
   - For the `custom` profiles, this value is `attached`.
   - For the `tiered` profiles, this value is empty because changes to IOPS are not supported in any state. If you want to change the IOPS value of a volume, you can change to another `tiered` profile.
   - For the `sdp` profile, this value is `attached, unattached`.
- `adjustable_bandwidth_supported` indicates whether the provisioned bandwidth limit can be adjusted.
   - For the `custom` and `tiered` profiles, this value is `false`.
   - For the `sdp` profile, this value is `true`.
- `storage_generation` indicates which generation the profile family belongs to.
   - For the `custom` and `tiered` profiles, this value is `1`.
   - For the `sdp` profile, this value is `2`.

The new profile is listed as `sdp`. To see details of this profile, make a `GET /volume/profiles/sdp` request.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://us-south.iaas.cloud.ibm.com/v1/volume/profiles/sdp?version=2024-09-24&generation=2"\
 -H "Authorization: $iam_token"

### With Terraform
{: #using-terraform-iops-profiles}
{: terraform}

1. To use Terraform, download the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Provider plug-in. For more information, see [Getting started with Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).

2. VPC infrastructure services use a specific regional endpoint, which targets to `us-south` by default. If your VPC is created in another region, make sure to target the appropriate region in the provider block in the `provider.tf` file. See the following example of targeting a region other than the default `us-south`.

   ```terraform 
   provider "ibm" {
      region = "eu-de"
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Import the list of available volume profiles as a read-only data source. 

   ```terraform
   data "ibm_is_volume_profiles" "example" {
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   For more information, see [ibm_is_volume_profile](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_volume_profiles){: external}.
