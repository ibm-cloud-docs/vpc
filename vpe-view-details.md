## Viewing details of an endpoint gateway using the CLI
{: #vpe-viewing-details-cli}
{: cli}

Before you begin, [set up your CLI environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli).

To view details of an endpoint gateway from the CLI, enter the following command:

```sh
  ibmcloud is endpoint-gateway ENDPOINT_GATEWAY [--json]
```
{: pre}

Where:

* **ENDPOINT_GATEWAY** is the ID of the endpoint gateway.
* **--json** formats the output in JSON format.

## Viewing details of an endpoint gateway using the API
{: #vpe-viewing-details-api}
{: api}

To view details of an endpoint gateway with the API, follow these steps:

1. Set up your [API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment#api-prerequisites-setup).
1. Store the following values in variables to be used in the API command:

    ```sh
    export EndpointGatewayId=<endpoint_gateway_id>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. When the variables are initiated, view details of the endpoint gateway:

   ```sh
   curl  -sH "Authorization:${iam_token}"
     "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/endpoint_gateways/$EndpointGatewayId?version=$api_version&generation=2"
   ```
   {: pre}
