# Security best practices for the metadata service for bare metal servers
{: #metadata-security-best-practices-bare-metal}

IBM takes data security seriously and recommends that you follow these best practices to help make sure that you have the highest level of protection for your bare metal server metadata.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #metadata-sec-overview-bare-metal}

Use the following information describes how to configure security safeguards to protect your metadata by using the following actions.

* Disabling the metadata service for a bare metal server or an account.
* Limiting or not assigning trusted profiles for compute resource identities.
* Enhancing network security.

## Disable the metadata service for a bare metal server or account
{: #metadata-disable--acct-bare-metal}

You can disable the service on an existing bare metal server where it is enabled. See [Enable or disable the bare metal server metadata service](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-configure-metadata-service-bare-metal#metadata-service-enable-bare-metal).

## Using the `iptables` firewall to limit access on Linux
{: #metadata-iptables-bare-metal}

Use the `iptables` Linux firewall utility to create a barrier between the metadata service link-local address (trusted network) and the internet (untrusted network). Defines rules that govern which traffic is allowed and which is blocked.

The following example uses Linux `iptables` and its owner module, based on its default installation Apache ID, to prevent the Apache Web server from accessing the metadata link-local address (169.254.169.254). It uses a deny rule to reject all bare metal server metadata requests from any process that's running as that user.

```sh
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner apache --jump REJECT
```
{: pre}

 This endpoint is accessible to all commands, processes, and software applications that are running within a bare metal server. Access to the API endpoint is not available outside the bare metal server. This step adds another level of security.
 {: note}

Another alternative is to use allow rules to define access to particular users or groups. Allow rules require you to decide what software needs access to bare metal server metadata. By defining rules, you can prevent software from accidentally accessing the metadata service if you later change the software or configuration on the bare metal server.

You can also define group usage of the allow rules. Add and remove users from a permitted group without changing the firewall rule.

The following example prevents access to the bare metal server metadata service by all processes, except for processes that are running in the user account `trustworthy-user`:

```sh
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner trustworthy-user --jump REJECT
```
{: pre}

## Limit trusted profiles for compute resource identities
{: #metadata-limit-trusted-profiles-bare-metal}

Limit trusted profiles that you create for compute resource identities. Optionally, don't assign a compute resource identity to a bare metal server.

When you [remove trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-trusted-profile-update&interface=ui#remove-tp-console){: ui}[remove trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-trusted-profile-update&interface=cli#remove-tp-cli){: cli}[remove trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-trusted-profile-update&interface=api#remove-tp-api){: api}, compute resources and federated users are unlinked from the profile, and can no longer apply the trusted profile identity.

You can also update existing trusted profiles by redefining the trust relationship, assigning access policies, and updating session limits. For more information, see [Updating trusted profiles](/docs/account?topic=account-trusted-profile-update).

## Extra network security measures
{: #metadata-network-security-bare-metal}

Consider the following options for controlling network traffic to your bare metal servers:

* Restrict access to your bare metal servers by using [security groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-configuring-the-security-group).

* Set up [access control lists](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-acls)(ACL) to control all incoming and outgoing traffic in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}}. An ACL is a built-in, virtual firewall, similar to a security group. In contrast to security groups, ACL rules control traffic to and from the subnets, rather than to and from the bare metal servers.

* Use a {{site.data.keyword.vpn_vpc_full}} to establish private connections from your remote networks to your VPCs.

* Use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} [Virtual Private Endpoints](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe) (VPE) for VPC to connect to supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services from your VPC network by using the IP addresses of your choosing, which are allocated from a subnet within your VPC. VPEs are virtual IP interfaces that are bound to an endpoint gateway created on a per service or service bare metal server basis.

* Use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} [flow Logs](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-flow-logs) on the VPC to monitor the traffic that reaches your bare metal servers.

* [Enable secure access](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-imd-configure-service&interface=ui#secure-access-ui) to the bare metal server metadata service. When secure access is enabled, the metadata service is accessible only to the bare metal server by encrypted HTTP secure protocol (HTTPS).

## Manage security and compliance with VPC Infrastructure Services
{: #metadata-compliance-bare-metal}

[{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started) can help you monitor your VPC infrastructure to validate resource configurations in your account against a profile and identify potential issues as they arise.

On 15 Dec 2025, {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} reaches end of support. The existing service instances become non-functional on that date. Start your transition now to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}, which is readily available and offers advanced cloud security posture management (CSPM). For more information, see [Transitioning to {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} {{site.data.keyword.sysdigsecure_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-scc-transition).
