View details about a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume or summary information about all volumes.
{: shortdesc}

## Viewing information about {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the console
{: #viewvols}
{: ui}

List all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes and view details for a single volume. View attached {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume details in instance details. View all snapshots that were created from the {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume.

### Viewing information about all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes in the console
{: #viewvols-ui}

Go to the list of {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](/login){: external}, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) **> Infrastructure** ![VPC icon](../icons/vpc.svg) **> Storage > Block Storage volumes**.

By default, {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes are displayed in sets of 10 for all resource groups in your region. Change this preset by clicking the Page Control down arrow and increase the list to 20 or 50 volumes. Use the Page Control arrows to go to the following page or return. In the list of all **{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes**, you see the following information.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Region | The region where these volumes are located, for example, US South. Click the down arrow to see volumes in a different region in which you have an account. |
| Name | Click the name of the volume to see individual volume details. |
| Status | Status of the volume, which functions as the default filter for all rows. |
| Location | Availability zone in your region, inherited from the VPC (for example, US South 1).|
| Size | Size of the volume you specified, in GBs.|
| Attachment type | Data, for a secondary volume attached to an instance, boot when attached as a boot volume, or blank for an unattached volume.|
| Health | Health monitors the overall health of the volume, such as I/O performance and data consistency. Volume health statuses are `OK` or `degraded`. Volumes in a degraded state have degraded performance, capacity, or experience connection problems. Volumes being restored from a snapshot also show a degraded state. The service displays a possible reason for the degraded state so that you can resolve any issues. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume health states](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-health-states). |
| Encryption | Encryption with IBM-managed keys is enabled by default on all volumes. You can also use your own root keys in a {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} or {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance to protect your data. For more information, see [Creating {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-encryption). |
| Tags | Number of user tags that are applied to the volume. Click the number in this column to view or edit the tags in the new window. If no tags were applied to the volume, click **Add tags** and add them in the new window. User tags can associate the volume with a [backup policy](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about) for creating backups of the volume. For more information, see [Adding user tags that are associated with a backup policy to a volume in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-block-storage&interface=ui#add-user-tags-volumes-ui).
| Actions | Click **Actions** ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") to display a menu of context-specific actions you can take.|
{: caption="Details about all volumes" caption-side="bottom"}

Actions menu selections change depending on whether the volume is a boot volume, an attached data volume, or an unattached data volume.
- When the volume that you're viewing is a boot volume, the available actions are **Create image**, **Create snapshot**, and **Detach from instance**.
- When the volume that you're viewing is an attached data volume, the available actions are **Create snapshot**, **Detach from instance**, and **Delete**.
- When the volume that you're viewing is an unattached data volume, the available actions are **Attach to instance**, and **Delete**.

For more information about these actions, see the following topics:
- [Creating an image from a volume in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-ifv&interface=ui#create-image-from-volume-vpc-ui)
- [Creating a snapshot in the console](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-create&interface=ui#snapshots-vpc-create-ui)

### Viewing details of a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume
{: #view-vol-details-ui}

To view details about a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume, go to the list of all {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes and select a volume.

Next to the name of the volume is the [volume status](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-status) and tags that are associated with this volume. [User tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=ui#storage-about-user-tags) identify the resource. When user tags are associated with a backup policy, they are used for creating [backup snapshots](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-about) of the volume. With [Access management tags](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=ui#storage-about-mgt-tags), you can create flexible resource groupings for managing access. For more information about these tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).

#### Volume-specific information.
{: #view-vol-details-overview}

The page has 3 tabs. By default, the Overview tab is selected for volume details.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Volume details** | |
| Name  | The name of the volume you specified when you created the volume. Click the **Edit icon** ![Edit icon](../icons/edit-tagging.svg "Edit") to edit the volume name. The volume name can be up to 63 lowercase alpha-numeric characters and include the hyphen (-), and must begin with a lowercase letter. Volume names must be unique for the account and for the region. |
| Volume ID | System-generated volume ID. |
| Health |  Health monitors the overall health of the volume, such as I/O performance and data consistency. Volume health statuses are `OK` or `degraded`. Volumes in a degraded state have less than OK performance and capacity, or they experience connection problems. Volumes that are being restored from a snapshot also show a degraded state. The service displays a possible reason for the degraded state so you can resolve it. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume health states](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-monitoring#block-storage-vpc-health-states). |
| Resource group | Resource group defined when you set up your VPC. Resource groups manage access to resources but do not affect billing or monitoring.|
| Attachment type | Data, for a secondary volume attached to an instance, boot when attached as a boot volume, or blank for an unattached volume.|
| Created date | System-generated date when the volume was created.|
| Location | Availability zone in your region.|
| Size | Size of the volume you specified. When the volume is attached to a virtual server instance and the volume is not at maximum capacity for its range, you can click the icon to expand the volume. For more information, see [expanding {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume capacity (Beta)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes). |
| Profile | [IOPS tier](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#tiers) or [custom IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles#custom) profile. Click the icon to [adjust IOPS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops) by selecting a different profile. |
| Max IOPS | The maximum IOPS value for a predefined IOPS tier or the value you specified for custom IOPS. |
| Throughput | The field shows the allocated bandwidth of the storage volume, which is measured in Gigabits per second (Gbps). Throughput is calculated as the result of the number of IOPS the volume is provisioned for times the throughput multiplier. Depending on the [volume profile](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), the throughput multiplier can be 16 KB or 256 KB. For volumes that are created with the `sdp` profile, the throughput value is customizable in the range of 1000-8192 Mbps.|
| Encryption | Encryption with IBM-managed keys is enabled by default on all volumes. You can also use your own root keys to protect your data. The Encryption field shows the name of the key management service (KMS) you provisioned (for example, {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}) and **customer-managed**. For more information, see [Creating {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with customer-managed encryption](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-vpc-encryption).|
| Encryption Instance | _Optional._ A link to the provisioned KMS instance for a customer-managed encryption volume. |
| Key | _Optional._ The name and copiable ID of the root key that is used to encrypt the passphrase, which secures a customer-managed encryption volume. |
| Backup policies | The number of backup policies that are associated with the volume. Click the number link to go to the backup policies tab. |
| Snapshots | The number of snapshots that were created of the volume. Click the number link to go to the Snapshots and Backups tab. |
| **Attached virtual server** | Volumes attached to a virtual server instance are listed here. Click **Attach** to select an instance to attach this volume. For more information, see [Attaching a volume to an instance](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-attaching-block-storage). |
| Status | This field tracks the overall lifecycle state of the volume, which ranges from volume creation to volume deletion. Attachment status, for example, is _attached_ when the volume is attached to an instance and _attaching_ when in progress. |
| Name | Click the name of the virtual server instance to see instance details. |
| Auto delete | When _enabled_, the volume is automatically deleted when you delete the instance. Click the toggle to enable automatic deletion. |
| **Backup policies** | Shows backup policies that are associated with this volume. To associate backup policies, you can add a backup policy's tags for target resources to this volume. Click **Apply** to select a backup policy, then apply its tags for the target resource to the volume. |

In the example, the volume is attached to a virtual server instance, so the names and IDs of the volume attachment and instance are also displayed in the command output. The `Active` property is `true` because the virtual server instance to which the volume is attached is running. The `Busy` property with the value `false` indicates that this volume is not performing an operation that must be serialized.

For more information about available command options, see [`ibmcloud is volume`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-vpc-reference#volume-view).

The allowed-use properties are inherited from the source image or snapshot that the parent boot volume was created from. By using the CLI or API, you can override these values when you create an instance or when you update the boot volume. You must have the `is.volume.volume.manage-allowed-use` IAM role to make these updates.

These properties comprise a Boolean [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md){: external} expression. When the expression is evaluated to be `true`, the virtual server instance or bare metal server provisioning is allowed with the boot volume or an image that was created from the boot volume. When the expression is evaluated to be `false`, the provisioning is blocked. For more information, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=cli).

## Viewing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with the API
{: #viewing-block-storage-api}
{: api}

View {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes programmatically by making calls to the [VPC REST APIs](/apidocs/vpc). You can list all volumes and view details for a specific volume.

Before you begin, make sure that you [set up your API environment](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage#block-storage-api-prereqs).

### Viewing all volumes with the API
{: #viewall-vol-api}

Make a `GET /volumes` call to list summary information about all volumes. See the following example.

```sh
curl -X GET "$vpc_api_endpoint/v1/volumes?version=2025-01-212&generation=2" \
-H "Authorization: $iam_token"
```
{: pre}

A successful response looks like the following example. This example shows three data volumes. The second in the list is attached to an instance.

### Extra API properties for boot volumes
{: #viewvol-boot}

When you request to view details of boot volumes, a couple of extra properties are returned in the response for `GET /volumes` and `GET /volumes/{id}` requests.

* The `active` property indicates whether the virtual server instance to which a volume is attached is running or stopped. When `active = true`, the instance is running and operations that require a running instance such as creating an [image from the boot volume](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-create-ifv#image-from-volume-vpc-api) also work.

* The `busy` property indicates whether this volume is performing an operation that must be serialized. If an operation requires serialization, the operation fails unless this property is `false`.

* The allowed-use expressions are inherited from the source image or snapshot that the parent boot volume was created from. You can update allowed-use expressions only on detached boot volumes. Using the CLI or API, you can override these values when you create an instance or by updating the boot volume. You must have the `is.volume.volume.manage-allowed-use` IAM role to make these updates. These properties comprise a Boolean [Common Expression Language](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md){: external} expression. When the expression is evaluated to be `true`, the virtual server instance or bare metal server provisioning is allowed with the boot volume or an image that was created from the boot volume. When the expression is evaluated to be `false`, the provisioning is blocked. For more information, see [Adding allowed-use expressions to custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-custom-image-allowed-use-expressions&interface=ui).

See the following example.

## Viewing {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes with Terraform
{: #viewing-block-storage-terraform}
{: terraform}

You can use Terraform to view information about your {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes.

To use Terraform, download the Terraform CLI and configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in. For more information, see [Getting started with Terraform](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started).
{: requirement}

VPC infrastructure services use a specific regional endpoint, which targets to `us-south` by default. If your VPC is created in another region, make sure to target the appropriate region in the provider block in the `provider.tf` file.

See the following example of targeting a region other than the default `us-south`.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-de"
}
```
{: screen}

### Viewing all volumes with Terraform
{: #viewall-vol-terraform}

Import the list of volumes that belong to an account as a read-only data source. You can filter by volume name, zone name, attachment state, encryption type, operating system family (applicable for boot volumes) or operating system architecture (applicable for boot volumes).

```terraform
data "ibm_is_volumes" "example" {
}
```
{: codeblock}

The attributes that are exported include the total count of volumes and the list of volumes. The nested attributes include volume ID, name, creation date, size, IOPS, CRN, access and user tags, profile, encryption type and key, lifecycle state, health state and reason, operating system, and other attributes.

For more information, see [ibm_is_volumes](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_volumes){: external}.

### Viewing volume details with Terraform
{: #viewvol-details-terraforn}

Import the details of a volume as a read-only data source. You must identify the volume by ID or name.

```terraform
data "ibm_is_volume" "example1" {
  name = ibm_is_volume.example.name
}
```
{: codeblock}

The attributes that are exported include the total count of volumes and the list of volumes. The nested attributes include volume ID, name, creation date, size, IOPS, CRN, access and user tags, profile, encryption type and key, lifecycle state, health state and reason, operating system, and other attributes.

For more information, see [ibm_is_volume](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/data-sources/is_volume){: external}.
