# Communicating connection information to consumers
{: #pps-ui-communicate}

To complete the connection to your service, you must communicate the following information to your consumers:

* Your Private Path serviceâ€™s cloud resource name (CRN)

   Open the Private Path details page of your [Private Path service](/infrastructure/network/privatePathServices) to locate its CRN. Click the Copy to clipboard icon to copy and paste the CRN in your communication to consumers.

* Instructions on creating a Virtual Private Endpoint (VPE) gateway

   Point consumers to instructions on [Creating a VPE gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ordering-endpoint-gateway) to create a non-IBM Cloud service connection request.

* The approximate time frame that your consumer must wait to get connected to your service

   The time that it takes for a consumer to get connected depends on you. For example, if you set the default policy to `permit`, all requests are automatically connected. Or, if you set an account policy to `permit` a certain account, again, the connection is approved and the consumer is connected. However, if you set the default or an account-specific policy to `review`, then you must review the connection request and either `permit` or `deny` it. If you don't review an incoming request within the expiration period when you created the Private Path service, the request expires and the consumer must create a new VPE gateway request. For more information, see [Reviewing connection requests](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-pps-ui-reviewing&interface=ui).

* Your contact information
* A URL to access the service, if necessary
* Any necessary port information that you might need to communicate
