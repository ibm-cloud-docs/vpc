# Known issues for Private Path services
{: #ppsg-limitations}

Known issues are identified bugs or unexpected behaviors that were not fixed before release, but werenâ€™t critical enough to delay it. These issues are communicated to you, often with workarounds, and are prioritized for resolution in the near term by the development team.
{: shortdesc}

Known issues for Private Path services are as follows:

* Private Path service supports providers and consumers in the same region. Currently, Private Path service does not support providers and consumers in different regions.
* Providers may not update service endpoints once the Private Path service is created. If they want to change endpoints, they must create a new Private Path service.
